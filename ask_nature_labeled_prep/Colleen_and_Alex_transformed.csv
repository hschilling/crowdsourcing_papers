0,Impact behaviour of freeze-dried and fresh pomelo (Citrus maxima) peel: influence of the hydration state,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.140322,"Pomelos (Citrus maxima) are known for their thick peel which—inter alia—serves as energy dissipator when fruits impact on the ground after being shed. It protects the fruit from splitting open and thus enables the contained seeds to stay germinable and to potentially be dispersed by animal vectors. The main part of the peel consists of a parenchymatous tissue that can be interpreted from a materials point of view as open pored foam whose struts are pressurized and filled with liquid. In order to investigate the influence of the water content on the energy dissipation capacity, drop weight tests were conducted with fresh and with freeze-dried peel samples. Based on the coefficient of restitution it was found that freeze-drying markedly reduces the relative energy dissipation capacity of the peel. Measuring the transmitted force during impact furthermore indicated a transition from a uniform collapse of the foam-like tissue to a progressive collapse due to water extraction. Representing the peel by a Maxwell model illustrates that freeze-drying not only drastically reduces the damping function of the dashpots but also stiffens the springs of the model.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.140322,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.140322,unknown
1,Distribution of unique red feather pigments in parrots,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2004.0269,"In many birds, red, orange and yellow feathers are coloured by carotenoid pigments, but parrots are an exception. For over a century, biochemists have known that parrots use an unusual set of pigments to produce their rainbow of plumage colours, but their biochemical identity has remained elusive until recently. Here, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of 44 species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families. We found that all species used the same suite of five polyenal lipochromes (or psittacofulvins) to colour their plumage red, indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots. Species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage, but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared. These polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers, suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet, but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2004.0269,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2004.0269,unknown
2,"Correlation between aquaporin and water permeability in response to vasotocin, hydrin and β-adrenergic effectors in the ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog Hyla japonica",10.1242/jeb.036871,"The ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog Hyla japonica expresses two kinds of arginine vasotocin (AVT)-stimulated aquaporins (AQP-h2 and AQP-h3), which affect the capacity of the frog's skin to absorb water. As such, it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability. We investigated AQP dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of H. japonica following challenge with AVT, hydrins (intermediate peptides of pro-AVT) and β-adrenergic effectors. In the in vivo experiment, both AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first-reacting cell (FRC) layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with AVT, hydrin 1 and hydrin 2, thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin. The β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IP) and its anatagonist propranolol (PP) in combination with AVT or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment. IP increased water permeability whereas PP inhibited it, and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the AQPs to the apical membrane. In the PP+AVT-treated skins, labels for AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 were differentially visible among the principal cells; the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not, indicating that the response of PP or AVT is different from cell to cell. These results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the FRC layers may have two kinds of receptors: a V2 receptor and β-adrenergic receptor.",[],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/288,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/288.full.pdf,unknown

Second, we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs, and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs. However, analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories, and thus were necessary for steering. Finally, we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving, the legs must change the plane in which they beat, which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water.

The passive adsorption of arthropod-repellent semi-volatiles to neighbouring foliage could convey associational resistance, whereby a plant's neighbours reduce damage caused by herbivores. We found that birch (Betula spp.) leaves adsorb and re-release the specific arthropod-repelling C(15) semi-volatiles ledene, ledol and palustrol produced by Rhododendron tomentosum when grown in mixed association in a field setup. In a natural habitat, a higher concentration of ledene was released from birches neighbouring R. tomentosum than from birches situated > 5 m from R. tomentosum. Emission of alpha-humulene, a sesquiterpene synthesized by both Betula pendula and R. tomentosum, was also increased in R. tomentosum-neighbouring B. pendula. In assessments for associational resistance, we found that the polyphagous green leaf weevils (Polydrusus flavipes) and autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) larvae both preferred B. pendula to R. tomentosum. P. flavipes also preferred birch leaves not exposed to R. tomentosum to leaves from mixed associations. In the field, a reduction in Euceraphis betulae aphid density occurred in mixed associations.

The proteins have a very unusual composition, with four relatively rare residues (tyrosine, methionine, arginine, and tryptophan) comprising approximately 57% of a reflectin, and several common residues (alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine) occurring in none of the family members.

7,The mechanics of the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods,10.1242/jeb.046706,"Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal.","['Attach', 'Move']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3920,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3920.full.pdf,unknown
8,Induced niche shift as an anti-predator response for an endoparasitoid,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.2029,"When two developmental stages do not share the same ecological niche, the control of the niche shift through a change in developmental timing, referred to as ‘heterokairy’, can provide an adaptive advantage for the individual (e.g. if mortality risk is higher in the first niche). For endoparasitic species that develop inside another (host) species, mortality of the host may directly induce mortality risk for the parasite. Thus, endoparasitoid larvae should be selected for response to host predation. In this study, aphids previously parasitized by the endoparasitoid Endaphis fugitiva, Gagné and Muratori (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), were experimentally exposed to increased mortality risks. Both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae. Parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid, allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation. Predator-induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls, but, interestingly, no effect on Endaphis adult size was found. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid, but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift.","['Protect from harm', 'Process information']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.2029,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.2029,unknown

Here, we use X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy with probing size of 40–200 nm. We resolve 3 distinct mineral phases: An initial short-lived, presumably hydrated ACC phase, followed by an intermediate transient form of ACC, and finally the biogenic crystalline calcite phase. The amorphous and crystalline phases are juxtaposed, often appearing in adjacent sites at a scale of tens of nanometers. We propose that the amorphous-crystal transformation propagates in a tortuous path through preexisting 40- to 100-nm amorphous units, via a secondary nucleation mechanism.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/105/45/17362,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/45/17362.full.pdf,unknown
10,Macroevolutionary assembly of ant/plant symbioses: Pseudomyrmex ants and their ant-housing plants in the Neotropics,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2200,"Symbioses include some of the clearest cases of coevolution, but their origin, loss or reassembly with different partners can rarely be inferred. Here we use ant/plant symbioses involving three plant clades to investigate the evolution of symbioses. We generated phylogenies for the big-eyed arboreal ants (Pseudomyrmecinae), including 72% of their 286 species, as well as for five of their plant host groups, in each case sampling more than 61% of the species. We show that the ant-housing Vachellia (Mimosoideae) clade and its ants co-diversified for the past 5 Ma, with some species additionally colonized by younger plant-nesting ant species, some parasitic. An apparent co-radiation of ants and Tachigali (Caesalpinioideae) was followed by waves of colonization by the same ant clade, and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group. Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize.

11,Precise Temperature Compensation of Phase in a Rhythmic Motor Pattern,,"Most animal species are cold-blooded, and their neuronal circuits must maintain function despite environmental temperature fluctuations. The central pattern generating circuits that produce rhythmic motor patterns depend on the orderly activation of circuit neurons. We describe the effects of temperature on the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis. The pyloric rhythm is a triphasic motor pattern in which the Pyloric Dilator (PD), Lateral Pyloric (LP), and Pyloric (PY) neurons fire in a repeating sequence. While the frequency of the pyloric rhythm increased about 4-fold (Q10∼2.3) as the temperature was shifted from 7°C to 23°C, the phase relationships of the PD, LP, and PY neurons showed almost perfect temperature compensation. The Q10's of the input conductance, synaptic currents, transient outward current (IA), and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih), all of which help determine the phase of LP neuron activity, ranged from 1.8 to 4. We studied the effects of temperature in >1,000 computational models (with different sets of maximal conductances) of a bursting neuron and the LP neuron. Many bursting models failed to monotonically increase in frequency as temperature increased. Temperature compensation of LP neuron phase was facilitated when model neurons' currents had Q10's close to 2. Together, these data indicate that although diverse sets of maximal conductances may be found in identified neurons across animals, there may be strong evolutionary pressure to restrict the Q10's of the processes that contribute to temperature compensation of neuronal circuits.",['Protect from harm'],https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000469,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000469&type=printable,unknown
12,Tree shrew lavatories: a novel nitrogen sequestration strategy in a tropical pitcher plant,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0311,"Nepenthes pitcher plants are typically carnivorous, producing pitchers with varying combinations of epicuticular wax crystals, viscoelastic fluids and slippery peristomes to trap arthropod prey, especially ants. However, ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats, thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome. Nepenthes lowii, a montane species from Borneo, produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function. Pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the ‘typical’ Nepenthes pattern, catching arthropod prey. However, pitchers produced by mature N. lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews, which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid. We tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen (N) source for N. lowii, finding that it accounts for between 57 and 100 per cent of foliar N in mature N. lowii plants. Thus, N. lowii employs a diversified N sequestration strategy, gaining access to a N source that is not available to sympatric congeners. The interaction between N. lowii and tree shrews appears to be a mutualism based on the exchange of food sources that are scarce in their montane habitat.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0311,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0311,unknown
13,Desaturation of exhaled air in camels,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1981.0009,"We have found that camels can reduce the water loss due to evaporation from the respiratory tract in two ways: (1) by decreasing the temperature of the exhaled air and (2) by removal of water vapour from this air, resulting in the exhalation of air at less than 100% relative humidity (r. h.). Camels were kept under desert conditions and deprived of drinking water. In the daytime the exhaled air was at or near body core temperature, while in the cooler night exhaled air was at or near ambient air temperature. In the daytime the exhaled air was fully saturated, but at night its humidity might fall to approximately 75% r. h. The combination of cooling and desaturation can provide a saving of water of 60% relative to exhalation of saturated air at body temperature. The mechanism responsible for cooling of the exhaled air is a simple heat exchange between the respiratory air and the surfaces of the nasal passageways. On inhalation these surfaces are cooled by the air passing over them, and on exhalation heat from the exhaled air is given off to these cooler surfaces. The mechanism responsible for desaturation of the air appears to depend on the hygroscopic properties of the nasal surfaces when the camel is dehydrated. The surfaces give off water vapour during inhalation and take up water from the respiratory air during exhalation. We have used a simple mechanical model to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism.",['Protect from harm'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1981.0009,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1981.0009,unknown

The 60+ Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a ‘Greenhouse Earth’ interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes.

Fast snap-trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals, mainly arthropods, for a substantial nutrient supply. We show that Drosera glanduligera, a sundew from southern Australia, features a sophisticated catapult mechanism: Prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch-sensitive snap-tentacle, which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue-tentacles; the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles.

The colors arising from the narrow band-gap reflection are shown to be highly saturated and, as a function of the incidence angle, cover a wide range of the visible and ultraviolet spectrum.

Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5–20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2010.2292,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2010.2292,unknown

These four phases and their variations play an important role in the attachment to differently structured surfaces.

There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to α-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin-like protease of insect origin. Analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that TD2 is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral TD1 isoform. The crystal structure of pTD2 provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of TD2 to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut. These findings demonstrate a role for gene duplication in the evolution of a plant defense that targets and co-opts herbivore digestive physiology.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5897,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5897.full.pdf,unknown

The viscous capturethreads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replacedthe dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and featureregularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellarthread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesiongenerated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test thehypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing asuspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiplethread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measurethe stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range fromsmall, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increasedstickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports theoperation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per dropletadhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contactcontribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these datasuggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span ofapproximately 12 droplets.","['Attach', 'Maintain structural integrity']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/4/553,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/4/553.full.pdf,unknown
22,Self-cleaning in tree frog toe pads; a mechanism for recovering from contamination without the need for grooming,10.1242/jeb.073809,"Tree frogs use adhesive toe pads for climbing on a variety of surfaces. They rely on wet adhesion, which is aided by the secretion of mucus. In nature, the pads will undoubtedly get contaminated regularly through usage, but appear to maintain their stickiness over time. Here, we show in two experiments that the toe pads of White's tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) quickly recover from contamination through a self-cleaning mechanism. We compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of (1) the whole animal on a rotatable platform and (2) individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage. In both cases, the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs, showing that use of the pads increases recovery. We propose that both shear movements and a ‘flushing’ effect of the secreted mucus play an important role in shedding particles/contaminants.","['Attach', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3965,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3965.full.pdf,unknown
23,Honeybee flight: a novel ‘streamlining’ response,10.1242/jeb.050310,"Animals that move rapidly through the air can save considerable energy by reducing the drag that they need to overcome during flight. We describe a novel ‘streamlining’ response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect. Thus, our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects, and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment.",[],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2215.short,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2215.full.pdf,unknown

We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to –80°C, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <–58°C and can avoid freezing to at least –150°C. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around –40°C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2.0 to winter lows near 0.4 mg mg–1 dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations (4–6 mol l–1) and thermal hysteresis.

To date, however, the chloride channel expressed in the basolateral membrane of mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells for Cl− uptake in freshwater (FW) fish is still unknown. In this study, the combination of bioinformatics tools [i.e. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Tetraodon nigroviridis (spotted green pufferfish) genome database (Genoscope), BLAT and BLASTn] were used to identify the gene of ClC-3 (TnClC-3), a member of the CLC chloride channel family in the T. nigroviridis genome. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the gene encoding for the ClC-3 protein was widely expressed in diverse tissues (i.e. gill, kidney, intestine, liver and brain) of FW- and seawater (SW)-acclimated pufferfish. In whole-mount double immunofluorescent staining, branchial ClC-3-like immunoreactive protein was localized to the basolateral membrane of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) immunoreactive cells in both the FW- and SW-acclimated pufferfish. In response to salinity, the levels of transcript of branchial TnClC-3 were similar between FW and SW fish. Moreover, the membrane fraction of ClC-3-like protein in gills was 2.7-fold higher in FW compared with SW pufferfish. To identify whether the expression of branchial ClC-3-like protein specifically responded to lower environmental [Cl−], the pufferfish were acclimated to artificial waters either with a normal (control) or lower Cl− concentration (low-Cl). Immunoblotting of membrane fractions of gill ClC-3-like protein showed the expression was about 4.3-fold higher in pufferfish acclimated to the low-Cl environment than in the control group. Furthermore, branchial ClC-3-like protein was rapidly elevated in response to acute changes of environmental salinity or [Cl−]. Taken together, pufferfish ClC-3-like protein was expressed in the basolateral membrane of gill MR cells, and the protein amounts were stimulated by hyposmotic and low-Cl environments. The enhancement of ClC-3-like protein may trigger the step of basolateral Cl− absorption of the epithelium to carry out iono- and osmoregulatory functions of euryhaline pufferfish gills.",[],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/683,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/683.full.pdf,unknown
26,Evolution-guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1990-9,"Addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug-resistant infections1. Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family2. Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter2. Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics—the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin—that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins—essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection.","['Protect from harm', 'Maintain ecological community']",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1990-9,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1990-9.pdf,unknown

They are easily identified in genomes by their tendency to colocalize the associated genes into a large gene cluster called a superlocus.Carboxysomes (CO2-fixing organelles) were the first type of bacterial microcompartment to be identified, but recently, many more have been discovered and characterized; they are involved in catabolizing a variety of nutrients and enable cells to grow in otherwise unavailable niches.The shell and cargo of bacterial microcompartments self-assemble using different pathways; some build the shell around a cargo aggregate, whereas others assemble the shell and cargo concomitantly. There are proteins that facilitate cargo aggregation and small encapsulation peptides that specifically associate proteins to the lumen of the shell.Bacterial microcompartments are linked to the pathogenesis of certain bacteria because they confer a growth advantage. For example, the human gut is enriched in propanediol and ethanolamine, initial substrates of specific bacterial microcompartments.The knowledge gained from understanding the native functions has led to substantial progress in modifying the shell for bioengineering purposes.

forces of the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus",10.1242/jeb.01831,"Mantis shrimp are renowned for their unusual method of breaking shells withbrief, powerful strikes of their raptorial appendages. Due to the extremespeeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendagesand hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contributionof the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimpOdontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that eachstrike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically390–480 μs apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements andacoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by thelimb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitationbubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitationforces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus cangenerate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, onaverage, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, althoughcavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapidsuccession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantisshrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily highimpact forces to fracture shells. The stomatopod's hammer is fundamentallydifferent from typical shell-crushing mechanisms such as fish jaws and lobsterclaws, and may have played an important and as yet unexamined role in theevolution of shell form.","['Protect from harm', 'Chemically modify']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/19/3655,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/19/3655.full.pdf,unknown

The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex β-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements.",['Attach'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22057952/,pubmed,,unknown

The types of OHCB that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of OHCB, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success.

Previous studies have suggested that the resistance of these species is due to the presence of cutaneous bacteria producing antifungal metabolites. As our understanding of these metabolites is still limited, we assessed the potential of such compounds against human-relevant fungi such as Aspergillus. In this work we isolated 201 bacterial strains from fifteen samples belonging to seven frog species collected in the highlands of Panama and tested them against Aspergillus fumigatus. Among the 29 bacterial isolates that exhibited antifungal activity, Pseudomonas cichorii showed the greatest inhibition. To visualize the distribution of compounds and identify them in the inhibition zone produced by P. cichorii, we employed MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) and MS/MS molecular networking.

34,Experimental Studies and Dynamics Modeling Analysis of the Swimming and Diving of Whirligig Beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae),,"Whirligig beetles (Coleoptera, Gyrinidae) can fly through the air, swiftly swim on the surface of water, and quickly dive across the air-water interface. The propulsive efficiency of the species is believed to be one of the highest measured for a thrust generating apparatus within the animal kingdom. The goals of this research were to understand the distinctive biological mechanisms that allow the beetles to swim and dive, while searching for potential bio-inspired robotics applications. Through static and dynamic measurements obtained using a combination of microscopy and high-speed imaging, parameters associated with the morphology and beating kinematics of the whirligig beetle's legs in swimming and diving were obtained. Using data obtained from these experiments, dynamics models of both swimming and diving were developed. Through analysis of simulations conducted using these models it was possible to determine several key principles associated with the swimming and diving processes. First, we determined that curved swimming trajectories were more energy efficient than linear trajectories, which explains why they are more often observed in nature. Second, we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs, and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs. However, analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories, and thus were necessary for steering. Finally, we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving, the legs must change the plane in which they beat, which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water. We have further examined how the principles learned from this study may be applied to the design of bio-inspired swimming/diving robots.",['Move'],https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002792,plos,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002792&type=printable,unknown

Hatchlings are limited tothe tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinousplankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and aregigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water.This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in trachealstructure related to diving and exposure to cold.

37,How Archer Fish Achieve a Powerful Impact: Hydrodynamic Instability of a Pulsed Jet in Toxotes jaculatrix,,"Archer fish knock down insects anchored to vegetation by hitting them with a precisely aimed jet of water. The striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects. The origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish, in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power. Here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of Toxotes jaculatrix. We estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about 3000 W/kg, which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of 500 W/kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle. Unexpectedly, we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish, and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in Drop-on-Demand inkjet printing. The investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single, large, water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum. The observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy.",['Process resources'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047867,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047867&type=printable,unknown

We use a phylogenomic approach—ultraconserved element sequence capture—to investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism: Neotropical acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group) and their associated Vachellia hostplants. In this system, the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of Central America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the pre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats, into an environment with more intense plant herbivory.

40,The role of granules within viscous capture threads of orb-weaving spiders,10.1242/jeb.036947,"Sticky viscous prey capture threads form the spiral elements of spider orb-webs and are responsible for retaining insects that strike a web. These threads are formed of regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers. When a thread is flattened on a microscope slide a small, opaque granule can usually be seen within each droplet. These granules have been thought to be the glycoprotein glue that imparts thread adhesion. Both independent contrast and standard regressions showed that granule size is directly related to droplet volume and indicated that granule volume is about 15% of droplet volume. We attempted to find support for the hypothesized adhesive role of granules by establishing an association between the contact surface area and volume of these granules and the stickiness of the viscous threads of 16 species in the context of a six-variable model that describes thread stickiness. However, we found that granule size made either an insignificant or a small negative contribution to thread stickiness. Consequently, we hypothesize that granules serve to anchor larger, surrounding layers of transparent glycoprotein glue to the axial fibers of the thread, thereby equipping droplets to resist slippage on the axial fibers as these droplets generate adhesion, elongate under a load, and transfer force to the axial fibers.","['Attach', 'Maintain structural integrity']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/339,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/339.full.pdf,unknown
41,Protein Oxidation Implicated as the Primary Determinant of Bacterial Radioresistance,,"In the hierarchy of cellular targets damaged by ionizing radiation (IR), classical models of radiation toxicity place DNA at the top. Yet, many prokaryotes are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage. Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered D. radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in D. radiodurans, but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria, our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation. We present the case that protein, rather than DNA, is the principal target of the biological action of IR in sensitive bacteria, and extreme resistance in Mn-accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection.",['Protect from harm'],https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050092,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050092&type=printable,unknown

Reproduction of the bdelloids Adineta vaga and Philodina roseola is much more resistant to IR than that of Euchlanis dilatata, a rotifer belonging to the desiccation-intolerant and facultatively sexual class Monogononta, and all other animals for which we have found relevant data. By analogy with the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes DNA breakage that is repaired upon rehydration. Such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/105/13/5139,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/13/5139.full.pdf,unknown
43,Flow-dependent porosity and other biomechanical properties of mysticete baleen,10.1242/jeb.078931,"Despite its vital function in a highly dynamic environment, baleen is typically assumed to be a static material. Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature ‘racks’, in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90 deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles.",[],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1152,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1152.full.pdf,unknown
44,"Absence of eye shine and tapetum in the heterogeneous eye of
Anthocharis butterflies (Pieridae)",10.1242/jeb.002725,"Insect eyes are composed of spectrally heterogeneous ommatidia, typicallywith three different types. The ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies can beidentified non-invasively by the colorful eye shine, the reflection from thetapetal mirror located at the proximal end of the ommatidia, which can beobserved by epi-illumination microscopy. Since the color of eye shine isdetermined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia, it has beententatively related to color vision. In the course of a survey of ommatidialheterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genusAnthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy ofthe eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated itwith the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of theancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in thepapilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis.Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape,peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can bedivided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in theretina.","['Protect from harm', 'Change size or color']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/17/3075,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/17/3075.full.pdf,unknown
45,Molecular basis of infrared detection by snakes,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08943,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a ‘thermal image’ of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.",['Process information'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08943,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08943.pdf,unknown
46,The Great Silk Alternative: Multiple Co-Evolution of Web Loss and Sticky Hairs in Spiders,,"Spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods. Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided.",['Attach'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062682,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062682&type=printable,unknown

Biofilms are often extremely tolerant to antimicrobials but their reliance on shared EPS may also be a weakness as social evolution theory predicts that inhibiting shared traits can select against resistance. Here we show that EPS of Salmonella biofilms is a cooperative trait whose benefit is shared among cells, and that EPS inhibition reduces both cell attachment and antimicrobial tolerance. We then compare an EPS inhibitor to conventional antimicrobials in an evolutionary experiment. While resistance against conventional antimicrobials rapidly evolves, we see no evolution of resistance to EPS inhibition. We further show that a resistant strain is outcompeted by a susceptible strain under EPS inhibitor treatment, explaining why resistance does not evolve. Our work suggests that targeting cooperative traits is a viable solution to the problem of antimicrobial resistance.","['Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13660-x,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13660-x.pdf,unknown
48,Characterization of mechanisms for Ca2+ and HCO3–/CO32– acquisition for shell formation in embryos of the freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis,10.1242/jeb.045088,"The freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis produces embryos that complete direct development, hatching as shell-bearing individuals within 10 days despite relatively low ambient calcium and carbonate availability. This development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and/or carbonate. In this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both Ca2+ and accumulation of carbonate in post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos. Using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion-specific microelectrode analytical techniques, we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central in the acquisition of both shell-forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels the uptake of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly an electrogenic Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO –3. Thus, hydration of endogenous CO2 forms HCO –3 for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake, as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification. The connections between Ca2+ and HCO–3 acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient, embryonic calcification in freshwater.",['Maintain ecological community'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4092,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4092.full.pdf,unknown
49,Functional Dorsoventral Symmetry in Relation to Lift-Based Swimming in the Ocean Sunfish Mola mola,,"The largest (up to 2 tons) and a globally distributed teleost—the ocean sunfish Mola mola—is commonly regarded as a planktonic fish because of its unusual shape including absence of caudal fin. This common view was recently questioned because the horizontal movements of the ocean sunfish tracked by acoustic telemetry were independent of ocean currents. However, direct information regarding their locomotor performance under natural conditions is still lacking. By using multi-sensor tags, we show that sunfish indeed swam continuously with frequent vertical movements at speeds of 0.4–0.7 m s–1, which is similar to the records of other large fishes such as salmons, marlins, and pelagic sharks. The acceleration data revealed that they stroked their dorsal and anal fins synchronously (dominant frequency, 0.3–0.6 Hz) to generate a lift-based thrust, as penguins do using two symmetrical flippers. Morphological studies of sunfish (mass, 2–959 kg) showed that the dorsal and anal fins had similar external (symmetrical shape and identical area) and internal (identical locomotory muscle mass) features; however, the muscle shape differed markedly. We conclude that ocean sunfish have functional dorsoventral symmetry with regards to the non-homologous dorsal and anal fins that act as a pair of vertical hydrofoils. Although sunfish lack a swimbladder, we found that they are neutrally buoyant independent of depth because of their subcutaneous gelatinous tissue that has low density and is incompressible. Efficient lift-based swimming in conjunction with neutral buoyancy enables sunfish to travel long distances both horizontally and vertically.",['Move'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003446,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003446&type=printable,unknown

They are thought to fulfil primarily the ecological niche of scavengers in the deep ocean. However, we present new footage from baited video cameras that captured images of hagfishes actively preying on other fish. Video images also revealed that hagfishes are able to choke their would-be predators with gill-clogging slime. This is the first time that predatory behaviour has been witnessed in this family and also demonstrates the instantaneous effectiveness of hagfish slime to deter fish predators. These observations suggest that the functional adaptations and ecological role of hagfishes, past and present, might be far more diverse than previously assumed. We propose that the enduring success of this oldest extant family of fishes over 300 million years could largely be due to their unique combination of functional traits.","['Change size or color', 'Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00131,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00131.pdf,unknown
51,The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications,10.1242/jeb.063040,"It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo® ‘shark skin-like’ swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/785,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/785.full.pdf,unknown

Tropoelastin is the soluble precursor to elastin, the main elastic protein found in mammals. Little is known of the shape and mechanism of assembly of tropoelastin as its unique composition and propensity to self-associate has hampered structural studies. In this study, we solve the nanostructure of full-length and corresponding overlapping fragments of tropoelastin using small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, allowing us to identify discrete regions of the molecule. Tropoelastin is an asymmetric coil, with a protruding foot that encompasses the C-terminal cell interaction motif. We show that individual tropoelastin molecules are highly extensible yet elastic without hysteresis to perform as highly efficient molecular nanosprings. Our findings shed light on how biology uses this single protein to build durable elastic structures that allow for cell attachment to an appended foot.

53,Foam nest components of the túngara frog: a cocktail of proteins conferring physical and biological resilience,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.1939,"The foam nests of the túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1939,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1939,unknown

Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Chemically modify']",https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10325,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10325.pdf,unknown
55,Contribution of the alternative pathway to respiration during thermogenesis in flowers of the sacred lotus,10.1104/pp.105.075523,"We report results from in vivo measurements, using oxygen isotope discrimination techniques, of fluxes through the alternative and cytochrome respiratory pathways in thermogenic plant tissue, the floral receptacle of the sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). Fluxes through both pathways were measured in thermoregulating flowers undergoing varying degrees of thermogenesis in response to ambient temperature. Significant increases in alternative pathway flux were found in lotus receptacles with temperatures 16 degrees C to 20 degrees C above ambient, but not in those with lesser amounts of heating. Alternative pathway flux in the hottest receptacles was 75% of the total respiratory flux. In contrast, fluxes through the cytochrome pathway did not change significantly during thermogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that increased flux through the alternative pathway is responsible for heating in the lotus and that it is unlikely that uncoupling proteins, which would have produced increased fluxes through the cytochrome pathway, contribute significantly to heating in this tissue. Comparisons of actual flux, with capacity determined using inhibitors, suggested that the alternative pathway was operating at close to maximum capacity in heating tissues of lotus. However, in nonheating tissues the inhibitor data significantly overestimated the alternative pathway flux. This confirms that isotopic measurements are necessary for accurate determination of fluxes through the two pathways.","['Process information', 'Chemically modify']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16461386/,pubmed,,unknown

59,Why Do Woodpeckers Resist Head Impact Injury: A Biomechanical Investigation,,"Head injury is a leading cause of morbidity and death in both industrialized and developing countries. It is estimated that brain injuries account for 15% of the burden of fatalities and disabilities, and represent the leading cause of death in young adults. Brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and/or angular velocity of the head. However, the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of 6–7 m/s with a deceleration of 1000 g when it drums a tree trunk. It is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury. In order to investigate this, two synchronous high-speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process, and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force. The mechanical properties and macro/micro morphological structure in woodpecker's head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro-CT scanning. Finite element (FE) models of the woodpecker's head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses. The result showed that macro/micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non-impact-injuries.

The molecular basis of spore dormancy and resistance is not understood, but the physical state of water in the different spore compartments is thought to play a key role. To characterize this water in situ, we recorded the water 2H and 17O spin relaxation rates in D2O-exchanged Bacillus subtilis spores over a wide frequency range. The data indicate high water mobility throughout the spore, comparable with binary protein–water systems at similar hydration levels. Even in the dense core, the average water rotational correlation time is only 50 ps. Spore dormancy therefore cannot be explained by glass-like quenching of molecular diffusion but may be linked to dehydration-induced conformational changes in key enzymes. The data demonstrate that most spore proteins are rotationally immobilized, which may contribute to heat resistance by preventing heat-denatured proteins from aggregating irreversibly. We also find that the water permeability of the inner membrane is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than for model membranes, consistent with the reported high degree of lipid immobilization in this membrane and with its proposed role in spore resistance to chemicals that damage DNA.

To study the mechanism of hyperacidification, the kinetics of ATP-driven proton pumping by tonoplast vesicles from lemon fruits and epicotyls were compared. Fruit vacuolar membranes. H+ pumping by epicotyl membranes was chloride-dependent, stimulated by sulfate, and inhibited by the classical vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors nitrate, bafilomycin, N-ethylmaleimide, and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In addition, the epicotyl H+ pumping activity was inactivated by oxidation was reversed by dithiothreitol. Cold inactivation of the epicotyl V-ATPase by nitrate ( > or = 100 mM) was correlated with the release of V1 complexes from the membrane. In contrast, H+ pumping by the fruit tonoplast-enriched membranes was chloride-independent, largely insensitive to the V-ATPase inhibitors, and resistant to oxidation. Unlike the epicotyl inhibitors, and resistant to oxidation. Unlike the epicotyl H(+)-ATPase, the fruit H(+)-ATPase activity was partially inhibited by 200 microM vanadate. Cold inactivation treatment failed to inhibit H+ pumping activity of the fruit membranes, even though immunoblasts showed that V1 complexes were released from the membrane. However, cold inactivation doubled the percent inhibition by 200 microM vanadate from 30% to 60%.

Structural color is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, but has been little studied in plants. We present a striking example of multilayer-based strong iridescent coloration in plants, in the fruit of Pollia condensata. The color is caused by Bragg reflection of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils that form multilayers in the cell walls of the epicarp. We demonstrate that animals and plants have convergently evolved multilayer-based photonic structures to generate colors using entirely distinct materials. The bright blue coloration of this fruit is more intense than that of any previously described biological material. Uniquely in nature, the reflected color differs from cell to cell, as the layer thicknesses in the multilayer stack vary, giving the fruit a striking pixelated or pointillist appearance.

In a BES, bacteria interact with electrodes using electrons, which are either removed or supplied through an electrical circuit. The most-described type of BES is microbial fuel cells (MFCs), in which useful power is generated from electron donors as, for example, present in wastewater. This form of charge transport, known as extracellular electron transfer, was previously extensively described with respect to metals such as iron and manganese. The importance of these interactions in global biogeochemical cycles is essentially undisputed. A wide variety of bacteria can participate in extracellular electron transfer, and this phenomenon is far more widespread than previously thought. The use of BESs in diverse research projects is helping elucidate the mechanism by which bacteria shuttle electrons externally. New forms of interactions between bacteria have been discovered demonstrating how multiple populations within microbial communities can co-operate to achieve energy generation. New environmental processes that were difficult to observe or study previously can now be simulated and improved via BESs. Whereas pure culture studies make up the majority of the studies performed thus far, even greater contributions of BESs are expected to occur in natural environments and with mixed microbial communities. Owing to their versatility, unmatched level of control and capacity to sustain novel processes, BESs might well serve as the foundation of a new environmental biotechnology. While highlighting some of the major breakthroughs and addressing only recently obtained data, this review points out that despite rapid progress, many questions remain unanswered.",['Chemically modify'],https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej20074,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej20074.pdf,unknown
65,Magnetosome formation in prokaryotes,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro842,"Magnetotactic bacteria are motile, generally aquatic microorganisms that can move along geomagnetic field lines. This group of fastidious prokaryotes is heterogeneous and all magnetotactic bacteria identified so far are Gram-negative.Magnetotactic bacteria behave essentially like miniature magnetic compass needles and can respond to the Earth's geomagnetic field because they synthesize intracellular structures, known as magnetosomes, which contain magnetic mineral crystals. Iron oxide magnetosomes contain magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals and iron sulphide magnetosomes contain greigite (Fe3S4) crystals.In their aquatic habitats, most magnetotactic bacteria are found at the oxic–anoxic interface. Magnetotaxis is believed to function in conjunction with aerotaxis to guide magnetotactic bacteria to areas of correct oxygen tension. There are two different mechanisms of magneto-aerotaxis: polar magneto-aerotaxis, in which the magnetic field provides an axis and a direction for motility, and axial-magneto-aerotaxis, in which the magnetic field only provides an axis for motility.The formation of magnetosomes — which are surrounded by a lipid bilayer approximately 3–4 nm thick — is a complex process, involving several discrete steps. At present, there is no evidence to indicate that magnetotactic bacteria use unique iron-uptake systems; evidence for the presence of siderophores in some magnetotactic species, including Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and Magnetospirillum magneticum, indicates that Fe(III) can be taken up as well as Fe(II). As yet it is unclear whether the magnetosome membrane vesicle is produced before the magnetic crystals have been formed, or whether the cytoplasmic membrane invaginates around the developing crystal.For many years, the inability of researchers to manipulate magnetotactic bacteria genetically hindered progress in elucidating the pathways that are involved in magnetosome synthesis. However, genetic systems for some magnetotactic bacteria have now been established. Additionally, genome sequencing of several species of magnetotactic bacteria is underway.",['Process information'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro842,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro842.pdf,unknown
66,Capillarity-based switchable adhesion,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0914720107,"Drawing inspiration from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature, we have engineered a switchable adhesion device. The device combines two concepts: The surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges can be significant (capillarity-based adhesion) and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control (switchable). The device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence. We demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size. This suggests that strengths approaching those of permanent bonding adhesives are possible as feature size is scaled down. In addition, controllability is fast and efficient because the attachment time and required voltage also scale down favorably. The device features compact size, no solid moving parts, and is made of common materials.",['Attach'],https://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3377,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3377.full.pdf,unknown

By saving on inherent costs, individuals that do not contribute socially have a selective advantage over altruists if both types receive equal benefits. Restrained consumption of a common resource is a form of altruism. The cost of this kind of prudent behavior is that restrained individuals give up resources to less-restrained individuals. The benefit of restraint is that better resource management may prolong the persistence of the group. One way to dodge the problem of defection is for altruists to interact disproportionately with other altruists. With limited dispersal, restrained individuals persist because of interaction with like types, whereas it is the unrestrained individuals that must face the negative long-term consequences of their rapacity. Here, we study the evolution of restraint in a community of three competitors exhibiting a nontransitive (rock–paper–scissors) relationship. The nontransitivity ensures a form of negative feedback, whereby improvement in growth of one competitor has the counterintuitive consequence of lowering the density of that improved player. This negative feedback generates detrimental long-term consequences for unrestrained growth. Using both computer simulations and evolution experiments with a nontransitive community of Escherichia coli, we find that restrained growth can evolve under conditions of limited dispersal in which negative feedback is present. This research, thus, highlights a set of ecological conditions sufficient for the evolution of one form of altruism.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_2/10831,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_2/10831.full.pdf,unknown

Scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated, but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized. We analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of 90 terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from 3 g to 3400 kg. We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals. Finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone, but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads. Allometry of bone's trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton's ability to withstand load, without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.0069,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.0069,unknown

This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 μm thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20–30 μm in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 μm wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red. The data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica-forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica-forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule, where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae.",['Physically assemble/disassemble'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2047,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2047.full.pdf,unknown
70,Bone density and the lightweight skeletons of birds,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,"The skeletons of birds are universally described as lightweight as a result of selection for minimizing the energy required for flight. From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes. By analogy, increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume. These data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight. They also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate, yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Move']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,unknown

These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here, we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor’s orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Process information']",https://www.pnas.org/content/108/46/18726,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/46/18726.full.pdf,unknown
72,Foldable structures and the natural design of pollen grains,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911223107,"Upon release from the anther, pollen grains of angiosperm flowers are exposed to a dry environment and dehydrate. To survive this process, pollen grains possess a variety of physiological and structural adaptations. Perhaps the most striking of these adaptations is the ability of the pollen wall to fold onto itself to prevent further desiccation. Roger P. Wodehouse coined the term harmomegathy for this folding process in recognition of the critical role it plays in the survival of the pollen grain. There is still, however, no quantitative theory that explains how the structure of the pollen wall contributes to harmomegathy. Here we demonstrate that simple geometrical and mechanical principles explain how wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways. We found that the presence of axially elongated apertures of high compliance is critical for achieving a predictable and reversible folding pattern. Moreover, the intricate sculpturing of the wall assists pollen closure by preventing mirror buckling of the surface. These results constitute quantitative structure-function relationships for pollen harmomegathy and provide a framework to elucidate the functional significance of the very diverse pollen morphologies observed in angiosperms.","['Change size or color', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.pnas.org/content/107/17/7635,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/17/7635.full.pdf,unknown

Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 °C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 °C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%–19% with a 10 °C drop, compared to >42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction. These results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection. We propose that organisms that use elastic recoil mechanisms for ecologically important movements such as feeding and locomotion may benefit from an expanded thermal niche.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Move']",https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5495,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5495.full.pdf,unknown

Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal.Conclusions/SignificanceThis is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses Anopheles as preferred prey, suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility.",[],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000132,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000132&type=printable,unknown

Existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes. We demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny, static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action. Instead, we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid-trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids. We also show that the tongue–fluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds, demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself, and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap. Our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity-based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds. Our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds, and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general.

77,Companion planting with French marigolds protects tomato plants from glasshouse whiteflies through the emission of airborne limonene,,"Horticulturalists and gardeners in temperate regions often claim that planting marigolds next to tomato plants protects the tomatoes from the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood). If shown to hold true, this technique could be used in larger-scale tomato production, protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro-ecosystems. Here we present two large-scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies. In the first, marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a 48 day infestation period. Here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development. Introducing additional whitefly-attractive ‘pull’ plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect, but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non-hosts of whiteflies (basil, nasturtium and Chinese cabbage) also reduces whitefly populations on tomato. The second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an ‘emergency’ measure. Here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period. Following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of French marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound, limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment. “Emergency” marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance, but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective. Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer ‘associational resistance’ against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Protect from harm']",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213071,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213071&type=printable,unknown

79,Deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces via mucin strands,10.1242/jeb.038075,"Hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of slime when threatened. The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 μm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100× longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces.","['Change size or color', 'Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1235,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1235.full.pdf,unknown

African wild dogs exhibit dominant-directed group living and take part in stereotyped social rallies: high energy greeting ceremonies that occur before collective movements. Not all rallies result in collective movements, for reasons that are not well understood. We show that the probability of rally success (i.e. group departure) is predicted by a minimum number of audible rapid nasal exhalations (sneezes), within the rally. Moreover, the number of sneezes needed for the group to depart (i.e. the quorum) was reduced whenever dominant individuals initiated rallies, suggesting that dominant participation increases the likelihood of a rally's success, but is not a prerequisite. As such, the ‘will of the group’ may override dominant preferences when the consensus of subordinates is sufficiently great.

Using this system, we discovered that, during rapid swimming of Giardia trophozoites, undulations of the caudal region contributed to forward propulsion combined with the beating of the flagella pairs. It was also discovered, in contrast to previous studies with 10 times slower image sampling technique, that the anterior and posterolateral flagella beat with a clearly defined power stroke and not symmetrical undulations. During the transition from free swimming to attachment, trophozoites modified their swimming behavior from a rapid rotating motion to a more stable planar swimming. While using this planar swimming motion, the trophozoites used the flagella for propulsion and directional control. In addition to examination of the posterolateral and anterior flagella, a model to describe the motion of the ventral flagella was derived, indicating that the ventral flagella beat in an expanding sine wave. In addition, the structure of the ventrocaudal groove creates boundary conditions that determine the form of beating of the ventral flagella. The results from this study indicate that Giardia is able to simultaneously generate both ciliary beating and typical eukaryotic flagellar beating using different pairs of flagella.","['Attach', 'Move']",https://www.pnas.org/content/108/34/E550,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/34/E550.full.pdf,unknown

Unlike the condition in modern reptiles, which experience hypercapnia when submerged in water, these animals would have experienced hypercapnia on land, owing to likely inefficient means of eliminating carbon dioxide. The different patterns of dermal bone sculpture in these tetrapods largely correlates with levels of terrestriality: sculpture is reduced or lost in stem amniotes that likely had the more efficient lung ventilation mode of costal aspiration, and in small-sized stem amphibians that would have been able to use the skin for gas exchange.",['Protect from harm'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.0558,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.0558,unknown

The major protein of these threads is flagelliform protein, a variety of silk fibroin. We present models for molecular and supramolecular structures of flagelliform protein, derived from amino acid sequences, force spectroscopy (molecular pulling) and stretching of bulk capture web. Pulling on molecules in capture-silk fibres from Araneus has revealed rupture peaks due to sacrificial bonds, characteristic of other self-healing biomaterials.

A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force–volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.",['Attach'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2850,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2850,unknown

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.",['Process resources'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.2784,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.2784,unknown

Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg–1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg–1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg–1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements.

This is particularly true for leaf-mining herbivorous insects that use deciduous leaves to fuel growth and reproduction even beyond leaf fall. Our results suggest that an intimate association with bacterial endosymbionts might be their way of coping with nutritional constraints to ensure successful development in an otherwise senescent environment. We show that the phytophagous leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella (Lepidoptera) relies on bacterial endosymbionts, most likely Wolbachia, to manipulate the physiology of its host plant resulting in the ‘green-island’ phenotype—photosynthetically active green patches in otherwise senescent leaves—and to increase its fitness. Curing leaf-miners of their symbiotic partner resulted in the absence of green-island formation on leaves, increased compensatory larval feeding and higher insect mortality.

Nonetheless, macroalgae break frequently.Here we investigate the possibility that repeated loading by sub-lethal forcescan eventually cause fracture by fatigue. We determine fracture toughness, inthe form of critical strain energy release rate, for several flat-bladedmacroalgae, thereby assessing their resistance to complete fracture in thepresence of cracks. Critical energy release rates are evaluated throughsingle-edge-notch, pull-to-break tests and single-edge-notch, repeated-loadingtests. Crack growth at sub-critical energy release rates is measured inrepeated-loading tests, providing a first assessment of algal breakage underconditions of repeated loading. We then estimate the number of imposed wavesrequired for un-notched algal blades to reach the point of complete fracture.We find that, if not checked by repair, fatigue crack growth from repeatedsub-lethal stresses may completely fracture individuals within days.

The parts comprise formations covered with complicated microstructures: fields of microtrichia on the rear surface of the head and post–cervical sclerites of the neck. The arrester immobilizes the head during feeding or when the dragonfly is in tandem flight. Thus, it may serve as an adaptation to save the head from violent mechanical disturbance and to stabilize gaze in a variety of behavioural situations. This study shows the evolutionary trend of the arrester in the order Odonata by using scanning electron microscopy and measurements of arrester structures in 227 species from 26 odonate families.

96,Mushrooms as Rainmakers: How Spores Act as Nuclei for Raindrops,,"Millions of tons of fungal spores are dispersed in the atmosphere every year. These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form a significant proportion of these aerosols, particularly above tropical forests. Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes. Our research heightens interest in the global significance of the fungi and raises additional concerns about the sustainability of forests that depend on heavy precipitation.","['Process resources', 'Move']",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407&type=printable,unknown

Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30–60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle. Our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non-equilibrium systems, including soft glasses and colloids.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020260,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020260&type=printable,unknown

These beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land. In air, adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid-covered setae and the substrate. In general, capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water. However, our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded, inclined substrata or even under water. Beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air, whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air. Oil-covered hairy pads had a pinning effect, retaining the air bubbles on their feet. Bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de-wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion. Additional capillary forces are generated by the pad's liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate.

In long-lived vertebrates, reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood, but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success. Lekking lance-tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes, as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek, but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely. Using 11 years of longitudinal data on age, social status and genetic siring success, I assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes. The data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience. At advanced ages, these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity. Individual ontogeny, rather than compositional change of the population, generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success; age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder, or success in the alpha role. Importantly, these findings suggest that social experience can mitigate the negative effects of senescence in older breeders.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2011.1840,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2011.1840,unknown

Flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral UV pigments, but DIPs had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity. We found the DIPs to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower, suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense. Indeed, feeding tests done with one of the DIPs (hypercalin A) showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar (Utetheisa ornatrix). The possibility that floral UV pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated.

Besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices. It has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects. However, our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism, mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface. First, we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of Nepenthes alata. Second, investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact 3D structure. Third, atomic force microscopy of the platelet-shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable, rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely. Fourth, the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size. By measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment.

To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10 degrees, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s(-1) and 4.2 m s(-1)). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0+/-4.6% (mean +/- S.E.M.) vs incline, 0.6+/-4.5%; PL: level, 0.1+/-1.0% vs incline, 0.4+/-1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4+/-8.4 J kg(-1) muscle vs incline, -6.8+/-7.5 J kg(-1) muscle; PL: level, -2.0+/-0.6 J kg(-1) muscle vs incline, -1.4+/-0.7 J kg(-1) muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.","['Move', 'Process resources']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14668306/,pubmed,,unknown

It was postulated that mechanical power amplification must be involved. Dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier. Inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo–skeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps. Most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle–tendon systems (knee extensor). Comparison with the external joint–powers revealed, however, an important power transport from this extensor (about 65%) to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi–articular calf muscles. Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle. Patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle–tendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification (times 15). It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well–developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push–off (i.e. when power requirements peak). Then, tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum, allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur.","['Process resources', 'Move', 'Physically assemble/disassemble']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1998.0313,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1998.0313,unknown

The light is produced from discrete areas on the snail's body beneath the snail's shell, and must thus overcome this structural barrier to be viewed by an external receiver. The diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material. Most strikingly, the shell, although opaque and pigmented, selectively diffuses the blue-green wavelength of the species bioluminescence. This diffusion generates a luminous display that is enlarged relative to the original light source.

They had been described by Schulze and represent the phylogenetically oldest class of siliceous sponges (phylum Porifera); they are eye-catching because of their distinct body plan, which relies on a filigree skeleton. It is constructed by an array of morphologically determined elements, the spicules. Soon after, during the German Deep Sea Expedition ""Valdivia"" (1898-1899), Schulze could describe the largest siliceous hexactinellid sponge on Earth, the up to 3-m high Monorhaphis chuni, which develops the equally largest bio-silica structure, the giant basal spicules (3 mx10 mm). Using these spicules as a model, basic knowledge on the morphology, formation, and development of the skeletal elements could be achieved. They are formed by a proteinaceous scaffold (composed of a 27-kDa protein), which mediates the formation of the siliceous lamellae, into which the proteins are encased. The high number of 800 of 5-10 microm thick lamellae is concentrically arranged around the axial canal. The silica matrix is composed of almost pure silicon oxide, providing it with unusually optophysical properties, which are superior to those of man-made waveguides. Experiments might suggest that the spicules function in vivo as a nonocular photoreception system. In addition, the spicules have exceptional mechanical properties, combining mechanical stability with strength and stiffness. Like demosponges, also the hexactinellids synthesize their silica enzymatically, via the enzyme silicatein (27-kDa protein). It is suggested that these basic insights will surely contribute to a further applied utilization and exploration of silica in bio-material/biomedical science.",['Physically assemble/disassemble'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19215903/,pubmed,,unknown
108,Ants recognize foes and not friends,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.1860,"Discriminating among individuals and rejecting non-group members is essential for the evolution and stability of animal societies. Ants are good models for studying recognition mechanisms, because they are typically very efficient in discriminating ‘friends’ (nest-mates) from ‘foes’ (non-nest-mates). Recognition in ants involves multicomponent cues encoded in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Here, we tested whether workers of the carpenter ant Camponotus herculeanus use the presence and/or absence of cuticular hydrocarbons to discriminate between nest-mates and non-nest-mates. We supplemented the cuticular profile with synthetic hydrocarbons mixed to liquid food and then assessed behavioural responses using two different bioassays. Our results show that (i) the presence, but not the absence, of an additional hydrocarbon elicited aggression and that (ii) among the three classes of hydrocarbons tested (unbranched, mono-methylated and dimethylated alkanes; for mono-methylated alkanes, we present a new synthetic pathway), only the dimethylated alkane was effective in eliciting aggression. Our results suggest that carpenter ants use a fundamentally different mechanism for nest-mate recognition than previously thought. They do not specifically recognize nest-mates, but rather recognize and reject non-nest-mates bearing odour cues that are novel to their own colony cuticular hydrocarbon profile. This begs for a reappraisal of the mechanisms underlying recognition systems in social insects.",['Process information'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1860,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1860,unknown

To address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems, we draw together three lines of inference. We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature (>70°C) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H2. The apparent dominance by H2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to >300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis. Thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic, hydrogen-based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem, even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Chemically modify']",https://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2555.full,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2555.full.pdf,unknown

The completed genome sequence of Syntrophus aciditrophicus SB, a model fatty acid- and aromatic acid-degrading syntrophic bacterium, provides a glimpse of the composition and architecture of the electron transfer and energy-transducing systems needed to exist on marginal energy economies of a syntrophic lifestyle. The genome contains 3,179,300 base pairs and 3,169 genes where 1,618 genes were assigned putative functions. Metabolic reconstruction of the gene inventory revealed that most biosynthetic pathways of a typical Gram-negative microbe were present. A distinctive feature of syntrophic metabolism is the need for reverse electron transport; the presence of a unique Rnf-type ion-translocating electron transfer complex, menaquinone, and membrane-bound Fe-S proteins with associated heterodisulfide reductase domains suggests mechanisms to accomplish this task. Previously undescribed approaches to degrade fatty and aromatic acids, including multiple AMP-forming CoA ligases and acyl-CoA synthetases seem to be present as ways to form and dissipate ion gradients by using a sodium-based energy strategy. Thus, S. aciditrophicus, although nutritionally self-sufficient, seems to be a syntrophic specialist with limited fermentative and respiratory metabolism.

To address this question, weobtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography),fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force(via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) andplantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and aninclined (10°, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force andfascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. Thisalso corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (dutyfactor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level andincline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch andshortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level,-1.0±4.6% (mean ± s.e.m.) vs incline,0.6±4.5%; PL: level, 0.1±1.0% vs incline,0.4±1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4±8.4 J kg-1muscle vs incline, -6.8±7.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL:level, -2.0±0.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline,-1.4±0.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither musclesignificantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during inclinehopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did notdiffer for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods ofactivation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), duringincline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design forspring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation iskey for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and theneed to accommodate changes in work associated with level versusincline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.","['Move', 'Process resources']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/2/211,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/2/211.full.pdf,unknown
112,Surface tension propulsion of fungal spores,10.1242/jeb.029975,"Most basidiomycete fungi actively eject their spores. The process beginswith the condensation of a water droplet at the base of the spore. The fusionof the droplet onto the spore creates a momentum that propels the sporeforward. The use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigmto perform work at small length scales. However, this mechanism of forcegeneration remains poorly understood. To elucidate how fungal spores makeeffective use of surface tension, we performed a detailed mechanical analysisof the three stages of spore ejection: the transfer of energy from the drop tothe spore, the work of fracture required to release the spore from itssupporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection.High-speed video imaging of spore ejection in Auricularia auriculaand Sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes placeover a short distance (∼5 μm) and energy transfer is completed in lessthan 4 μs. Based on these observations, we developed an explicit relationfor the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during thecoalescence process. The relation was validated with a simple artificialsystem and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately (predictedvelocity: 1.2 m s–1; observed velocity: 0.8 ms–1 for A. auricula). Using calibratedmicrocantilevers, we also demonstrate that the work required to detach thespore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of thetotal energy available for spore ejection.

Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2011.0059,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2011.0059,unknown

Retinal cryptochrome-expressing neurons and a forebrain region, “Cluster N”, show high neuronal activity when night-migratory songbirds perform magnetic compass orientation. By combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory-driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker ZENK during magnetic compass orientation, we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus. Thus, the two areas of the central nervous system being most active during magnetic compass orientation are part of an ascending visual processing stream, the thalamofugal pathway. Furthermore, Cluster N seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds “see” the reference compass direction provided by the geomagnetic field.",['Process information'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000937,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000937&type=printable,unknown

Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The “queen substance” [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/104/36/14383,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/36/14383.full.pdf,unknown

Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia–Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment–payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18091,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18091.full.pdf,unknown

Ectoparasitic gnathiid isopods (Gnathiidae), which feed on the blood of fish, are removed by cleaner fish during the day; however, it is unclear how parrotfish and wrasse avoid gnathiid attacks at night. To test the novel hypothesis that mucous cocoons protect against gnathiids, we exposed the coral reef parrotfish Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae) with and without cocoons to gnathiids overnight and measured the energetic content of cocoons. Fish without mucous cocoons were attacked more by gnathiids than fish with cocoons. The energetic content of mucous cocoons was estimated as 2.5 per cent of the fish's daily energy budget fish. Therefore, mucous cocoons protected against attacks by gnathiids, acting like mosquito nets in humans, a function of cocoons and an efficient physiological adaptation for preventing parasite infestation that is not used by any other animal.",['Protect from harm'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0916,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0916,unknown

The analysis of arm ossicles in Ophiocoma6 showed that in light-sensitive species, the periphery of the labyrinthic calcitic skeleton extends into a regular array of spherical microstructures that have a characteristic double-lens design. These structures are absent in light-indifferent species. Photolithographic experiments in which a photoresist film was illuminated through the lens array showed selective exposure of the photoresist under the lens centres. These results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue. The estimated focal distance (4–7 µm below the lenses) coincides with the location of nerve bundles—the presumed primary photoreceptors. The lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction. The optical performance is further optimized by phototropic chromatophores that regulate the dose of illumination reaching the receptors.

This paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach. Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle’s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m–2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage.

We propose a model for the modular organization of the MtrCAB complex in which MtrC is an extracellular element that mediates electron transfer to extracellular substrates and MtrB is a trans-OM spanning β-barrel protein that serves as a sheath, within which MtrA and MtrC exchange electrons.

Realistic wing kinematics are adopted in the numerical model by reconstructing the wing motion from high-speed imaging data of the bird. Lift history and the three-dimensional flow pattern around the wing in full stroke cycles are captured in the simulation. Significant asymmetry is observed for lift production within a stroke cycle. In particular, the downstroke generates about 2.5 times as much vertical force as the upstroke, a result that confirms the estimate based on the measurement of the circulation in a previous experimental study. Associated with lift production is the similar power imbalance between the two half strokes. Further analysis shows that in addition to the angle of attack, wing velocity and surface area, drag-based force and wing–wake interaction also contribute significantly to the lift asymmetry. Though the wing–wake interaction could be beneficial for lift enhancement, the isolated stroke simulation shows that this benefit is buried by other opposing effects, e.g. presence of downwash. The leading-edge vortex is stable during the downstroke but may shed during the upstroke.

Historically, in Eastern Europe, bed bugs were entrapped by leaves from bean plants, which were then destroyed; this purely physical entrapment was related to microscopic hooked hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy and videography, we documented the capture mechanism: the physical impaling of bed bug feet (tarsi) by these trichomes. This is distinct from a Velcro-like mechanism of non-piercing entanglement, which only momentarily holds the bug without sustained capture. Struggling, trapped bed bugs are impaled by trichomes on several legs and are unable to free themselves. Only specific, mechanically vulnerable locations on the bug tarsi are pierced by the trichomes, which are located at effective heights and orientations for bed bug entrapment despite a lack of any evolutionary association.

Dissostichus mawsoni Norman",10.1242/jeb.01312,"The eye lenses of the Antarctic nototheniid fishes that inhabit theperennially freezing Antarctic seawater are transparent at –2°C,whereas the cold-sensitive mammalian and tropical fish lenses displaycold-induced cataract at 20°C and 7°C, respectively. No cold-cataractoccurs in the giant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni lenswhen cooled to temperatures as low as –12°C, indicating highlycold-stable lens proteins. To investigate this cold stability, wecharacterised the lens crystallin proteins of the Antarctic toothfish, inparallel with those of the sub-tropical bigeye tuna Thunnus obesusand the endothermic cow Bos taurus, representing three disparatethermal climes (–2°C, 18°C and 37°C, respectively). Sizingchromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups,α/βH, β and γ, with γ crystallins beingthe most abundant (>40%) lens proteins in fish, in contrast to the cow lenswhere they comprise only 19%. The upper thermal stability of these crystallincomponents correlated with the body temperature of the species. Invitro chaperone assays showed that fish α crystallin can protectsame-species γ crystallins from heat denaturation, as well as lysozymefrom DTT-induced unfolding, and therefore are small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSP)like their mammalian counterparts. Dynamic light scattering measured anincrease in size of αγ crystallin mixtures upon heating, whichsupports formation of the αγ complex as an integral part of thechaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tunaα crystallins only partly protected toothfish γ crystallins, whilecow α crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial andno αγ interaction, respectively. Toothfish γ was likely tobe the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cowα plus toothfish γ incubation could chaperone cow γcrystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence ofuncomplexed cow α. This suggests that the inability of toothfish γcrystallins to fully complex with tuna α, and not at all with the cowα crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the proteinthat relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.",['Protect from harm'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/26/4633,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/26/4633.full.pdf,unknown

132,Always on the bright side of life: anti-adhesive properties of insect ommatidia grating,10.1242/jeb.043661,"The surface of some insect eyes consists of arrays of cuticular protuberances, which are 50–300 nm in diameter, and are termed corneal nipples or ommatidia gratings. They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.",['Protect from harm'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3457,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3457.full.pdf,unknown

The osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction. Even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls. The deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level (e.g. cell shape and size) and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale (e.g. cellulose fibril orientation). This paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field. Particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism.

Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers. These differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the Psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation, in addition to their role in communication and camouflage.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0716,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0716,unknown

Embryos develop a substantialtolerance to anoxia during early development, which peaks during diapause II.This extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained during the first 4 days ofpost-diapause II development and is then lost. Metabolism during anoxiaappears to be supported mainly by production of lactate, with alanine andsuccinate production contributing to a lesser degree. Anoxic embryos alsoaccumulate large quantities of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), a potentialprotector of neural function. It appears that the suite of charactersassociated with normal development and entry into diapause II in this speciesprepares the embryos for long-term survival in anoxia even while the embryosare exposed to aerobic conditions.

Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross-sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber's 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross-sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific :structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes. Thus, differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel.","['Move', 'Process resources']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15164371/,pubmed,,unknown

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets. These results suggest a link between protein nutrition and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator health.",['Protect from harm'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0986,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0986,unknown
138,Cross-linking by protein oxidation in the rapidly setting gel-based glues of slugs,10.1242/jeb.051581,"The terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus secretes a glue that is a dilute gel with remarkable adhesive and cohesive strength. The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165×103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20–35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40–165 (×103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15×103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue.",['Attach'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1699,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1699.full.pdf,unknown
139,A buckling region in locust hindlegs contains resilin and absorbs energy when jumping or kicking goes wrong,10.1242/jeb.068080,"If a hindleg of a locust slips during jumping, or misses its target during kicking, energy generated by the two extensor tibiae muscles is no longer expended in raising the body or striking a target. How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100–4800 μJ) or kick (1700 μJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23±14 deg at a velocity of 13.4±9.5 deg ms–1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32±16 deg at a velocity of 32.9±9.5 deg ms–1. It also buckled 8.5±4.0 deg at a rate of 0.063±0.005 deg ms–1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001–0.65 deg ms–1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 μJ on bending, of which 210 μJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin. A group of campaniform sensilla 300 μm proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements. The features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1151,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1151.full.pdf,unknown
140,Evidence for self-cleaning in gecko setae,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0408304102,"A tokay gecko can cling to virtually any surface and support its body mass with a single toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads. Each seta branches into hundreds of 200-nm spatulae that make intimate contact with a variety of surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces, no adhesive has been shown to self-clean. In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future.","['Attach', 'Move', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.pnas.org/content/102/2/385,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/2/385.full.pdf,unknown

Cellulolysis occurs as the result of the combined action of fungi and bacteria with different requirements. Earthworms influence decomposition indirectly by affecting microbial population structure and dynamics and also directly because the guts of some species possess cellulolytic activity. Here we assess whether the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny 1826) digests cellulose directly (i.e., with its associated gut microbiota) and also whether the effects of E. fetida on microbial biomass and activity lead to a change in the equilibrium between fungi and bacteria. By enhancing fungal communities, E. fetida would presumably trigger more efficient cellulose decomposition. To evaluate the role of E. fetida in cellulose decomposition, we carried out an experiment in which pig slurry, a microbial-rich substrate, was treated in small-scale vermireactors with and without earthworms. The presence of earthworms in vermireactors significantly increased the rate of cellulose decomposition (0.43 and 0.26% cellulose loss day(-1), with and without earthworms, respectively). However, the direct contribution of E. fetida to degradation of cellulose was not significant, although its presence increased microbial biomass (C(mic)) and enzyme activity (cellulase and beta-glucosidase). Surprisingly, as fungi may be part of the diet of earthworms, the activity of E. fetida triggered fungal growth during vermicomposting. We suggest that this activation is a key step leading to more intense and efficient cellulolysis during vermicomposting of organic wastes.",['Chemically modify'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16944346/,pubmed,,unknown

While this phenomenon is well known, the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected. Here, we analysed the global dynamics of food dissemination in Camponotus cruentatus workers, after feeding on a low (0.1 mol l−1) or on a high (1 mol l−1) sucrose concentration food source. We also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis. The results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration.

Spiders depend upon these propertiesfor survival, yet the impressive performance of silk is not limited solely totensile mechanics. Here, we show that silk also exhibits powerful cycliccontractions, allowing it to act as a high performance mimic of biologicalmuscles. These contractions are actuated by changes in humidity alone andrepeatedly generate work 50 times greater than the equivalent mass of humanmuscle. Although we demonstrate that this response is general and occursweakly in diverse hydrophilic materials, the high modulus of spider silk issuch that it generates exceptional force. Furthermore, because this effectalready operates at the level of single silk fibers, only 5 μm in diameter,it can easily be scaled across the entire size range at which biologicalmuscles operate. By contrast, the most successful synthetic muscles developedso far are driven by electric voltage, such that they cannot scale easilyacross large ranges in cross-sectional areas. The potential applicability ofsilk muscles is further enhanced by our finding that silkworm fibers alsoexhibit cyclic contraction because they are already available in commercialquantities. The simplicity of using wet or dry air to drive the biomimeticsilk muscle fibers and the incredible power generated by silk offer uniquepossibilities in designing lightweight and compact actuators for robots andmicro-machines, new sensors, and green energy production.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/13/1990,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/13/1990.full.pdf,unknown

Among these systems, there are some that deal with predefined surfaces, and others, in which one surface remains unpredictable. The first type of system occurs, for example, in wing-locking devices and head-arresting systems and is called probabilistic fasteners. The second type is mainly represented by insect attachment pads of two alternative designs: hairy and smooth. The relationship between surface patterns and/or mechanical properties of materials of contact pairs results in two main working principles of the frictional devices: mechanical interlocking, or maximization of the contact area.

Recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold, from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization, dispersion and re-concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions. Enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea (for example, Thermotoga maritime, Pyrobaculum islandicum), and their activity led to the formation of gold- and silver-bearing sinters in New Zealand's hot spring systems. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, Desulfovibrio sp., may be involved in the formation of gold-bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments; over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits. Iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans) are known to breakdown gold-hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization, and release associated gold in the process. These and other bacteria (for example, actinobacteria) produce thiosulphate, which is known to oxidize gold and form stable, transportable complexes. Other microbial processes, for example, excretion of amino acids and cyanide, may control gold solubilization in auriferous top- and rhizosphere soils. A number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold(I/III) complexes. Reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of (1) detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting, excreting and reducing gold complexes, possibly using P-type ATPase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles (for example, Salmonella enterica, Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans, Plectonema boryanum); (2) gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold-complexing ligands (for example, thiosulphate by A. ferrooxidans) or (3) using gold as metal centre in enzymes (Micrococcus luteus). C. metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two Australian sites, indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary ‘bacterioform’ gold. Formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold(III) chloride solution, was promoted by a cyanobacterium (P. boryanum) via an amorphous gold(I) sulphide intermediate. ‘Bacterioform’ gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates (QPC), where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria. This may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the Witwatersrand QPC, the world's largest gold deposit.",[],https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej200775,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej200775.pdf,unknown

The proposed mechanism involves the capacity of squalamine, a cationic amphipathic sterol, to neutralize the negative electrostatic surface charge of intracellular membranes in a way that renders the cell less effective in supporting viral replication.

Following assembly, some viral shells pass through a sequence of coordinated maturation steps that progressively strengthen the capsid. Nanoindentation measurements by atomic force microscopy enable tests of the strength of individual viral capsids. They show that concepts borrowed from macroscopic materials science are surprisingly relevant to viral shells. For example, viral shells exhibit ‘materials fatigue’ and the theory of thin-shell elasticity can account — in part — for atomic-force-microscopy-measured force–deformation curves. Viral shells have effective Young’s moduli ranging from that of polyethylene to that of plexiglas. Some of them can withstand internal osmotic pressures that are tens of atmospheres. Comparisons with thin-shell theory also shed light on nonlinear irreversible processes such as plastic deformation and failure.

Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30–60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle.

But there are insects that are capable of gluing their eggs to these surfaces by means of proteinaceous secretions. In this study, we analysed the bonding region between the eggs of Crioceris asparagi and the plant surface of Asparagus officinalis using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The wettability of the plant surface by egg secretion was compared with that by Aqua Millipore water, aqueous sugar solution and chicken egg white. Furthermore, the force required to remove C. asparagi eggs from the plant surface was measured, in order to evaluate the egg's bonding strength. Mean pull-off force was 14.7 mN, which is about 8650 times higher than the egg weight. Egg glue was observed spreading over the wax crystal arrays on the plant cladophyll and wetting them. Similar wetting behaviour on the A. officinalis surface was observed for chicken egg white. Our results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of insect egg adhesion on micro- and nanostructured hydrophobic plant surfaces is related to the proteinaceous nature of adhesive secretions of insect eggs. The secretion wets superhydrophobic surfaces and after solidifying builds up a composite, consisting of the solidified glue and wax crystals, at the interface between the egg and plant cuticle.",['Attach'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.1706,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.1706,unknown
152,How ticks get under your skin: insertion mechanics of the feeding apparatus of Ixodes ricinus ticks,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.1758,"The tick Ixodes ricinus uses its mouthparts to penetrate the skin of its host and to remain attached for about a week, during which time Lyme disease spirochaetes may pass from the tick to the host. To understand how the tick achieves both tasks, penetration and attachment, with the same set of implements, we recorded the insertion events by cinematography, interpreted the mouthparts’ function by scanning electron microscopy and identified their points of articulation by confocal microscopy. Our structural dynamic observations suggest that the process of insertion and attachment occurs via a ratchet-like mechanism with two distinct stages. Initially, the two telescoping chelicerae pierce the skin and, by moving alternately, generate a toehold. Subsequently, a breaststroke-like motion, effected by simultaneous flexure and retraction of both chelicerae, pulls in the barbed hypostome. This combination of a flexible, dynamic mechanical ratchet and a static holdfast thus allows the tick to solve the problem of how to penetrate skin and also remain stuck for long periods of time.",['Attach'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.1758,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.1758,unknown
153,Electron transfer in syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro2166,"Anaerobic methane formation and anaerobic methane oxidation are important microbial processes in the global carbon cycle. Both processes are mediated by syntrophic communities of bacteria and archaea. In methane formation, bacteria degrade organic compounds to form products that are substrates for the methanogenic archaea. In anaerobic methane oxidation, methanotrophic archaea degrade methane and form currently unknown compounds that are used as electron donors by sulphate-reducing bacteria.Hydrogen and formate are key components in interspecies electron transfer in facultative and obligate syntrophic methanogenic communities. In facultative syntrophy, anaerobic bacteria have an energetic advantage over the methanogens, but they are not essential for growth. In obligate syntrophic communities, bacteria and archaea degrade and grow on a substrate that each organism alone could not metabolize. This results in physical aggregation of bacteria and archaea, which may have led to the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell.Bacteria that grow in obligate syntrophic association with methanogens live at the limits of what is thermodynamically possible. They encounter an energetic barrier in the recycling of redox mediators. NADH oxidation can be coupled to proton reduction only at low hydrogen concentrations, which are created by the methanogen. FADH2 oxidation coupled to proton reduction requires not only a low hydrogen concentration but also supplementary energy input from reverse electron transfer. Possible mechanisms of reverse electron transfer can be deduced from available genome sequences.Simple substrates that are known typical substrates for methanogenic archaea, such as methanol, acetate and formate, can also be degraded by syntrophic communities of bacteria and archaea. Also, substrates that are considered easily fermentable might require syntrophic communities. This suggests that the anaerobic food chain in methanogenic environments is even more complex and more versatile than previously thought.The occurrence of the anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction has been demonstrated in many studies. It is clear that syntrophic communities of methanotrophic archaea, which perform reverse methanogenesis, and sulphate-reducing bacteria are involved. The mechanism of this syntrophic interaction is unclear. Analogous to methanogenic communities, we propose that multiple compounds are involved.",['Chemically modify'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2166,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2166.pdf,unknown
154,Aerodynamics of saccate pollen and its implications for wind pollination,10.3732/ajb.94.8.1371,"Pollen grains of many wind-pollinated plants contain 1-3 air-filled bladders, or sacci. Sacci are thought to help orient the pollen grain in the pollination droplet. Sacci also increase surface area of the pollen grain, yet add minimal mass, thereby increasing dispersal distance; however, this aerodynamic hypothesis has not been tested in a published study. Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated. Several fossils were studied, including bisaccate (Pinus, Pteruchus, Caytonanthus), monosaccate (Gothania), and nonsaccate (Monoletes) pollen types.",['Move'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21636505/,pubmed,,unknown

Unlike humans, most birds perceive UV light and several species communicate using the near UV spectrum. Indeed, UV reflectance in addition to the colour of songbird feathers has been recognized as an important signal when choosing a mate. The king penguin is endowed with several highly coloured ornaments, notably its beak horn and breast and auricular plumage, but only its beak reflects UV, a property considered to influence its sexual attraction. Because no avian UV-reflecting pigments have yet been identified, the origin of such reflections is probably structural. In an attempt to identify the structures that give rise to UV reflectance, we combined reflectance spectrophotometry and morphological analysis by both light and electron microscopy, after experimental removal of surface layers of the beak horn. Here, we characterize for the first time a multilayer reflector photonic microstructure that produces the UV reflections in the king penguin beak.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0322,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0322,unknown
156,The Kármán gait: novel body kinematics of rainbow trout swimming in a vortex street,10.1242/jeb.00209,"Most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamicperturbations during their lifetime. In this study, we provide evidence thatrainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their bodykinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment that arenot self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial swimming kinematicsin response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake characteristics. We comparedtrout swimming in the Kármán street behind different diametercylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and 4.5 Ls-1, where L is total body length) to trout swimming inthe free stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylindersadopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order tohold station, which we term the Kármán gait. During this gait,body amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming atan equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat frequencyis not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reducedflow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of thecylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocityoffered behind a cylinder (drafting), trout are also altering their bodykinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanismthat may not involve propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctivewhen cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trouthave a longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicatingthat only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a consistentmanner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that fish can captureenergy from vortices generated by the environment to maintain station indownstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in front of a cylinder displaylower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave speeds than trout subjected to any ofthe other treatments, implying that the bow wake may be the most energeticallyfavorable region for a fish to hold station near a cylinder.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/6/1059,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/6/1059.full.pdf,unknown

The biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. However this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized. Here we report ultra high-speed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast Itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus Auricularia auricula. Images taken at camera speeds of up to 100,000 frames/ s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. Recordings of I. perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of Buller's drop onto the spore, it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop. The release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus. Analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of 10,000 g. There is no known analog of this micromechanical process in animals, plants or bacteria, but the recent development of a surface tension motor may mimic the fungal biology described here.",['Process resources'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16457355/,pubmed,,unknown
158,Insects had it first: surfactants as a defence against predators,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.1281,"Insects have evolved an astonishing array of defences to ward off enemies. Well known and widespread is the regurgitation of oral secretion (OS), fluid that repels attacking predators. In herbivores, the effectiveness of OS has been ascribed so far to the presence of deterrent secondary metabolites sequestered from the host plant. This notion implies, however, that generalists experience less protection on plants with low amounts of secondary metabolites or with compounds ineffective against potential enemies. Resolving the dilemma, we describe a novel defence mechanism that is independent of deterrents as it relies on the intrinsic detergent properties of the OS. The OS of Spodoptera exigua (and other species) was found to be highly amphiphilic and well capable of wetting the hydrophobic cuticle of predatory ants. As a result, affected ants stopped attacking and engaged in extensive cleansing. The presence of surfactants was sufficient to explain the defensive character of herbivore OS. We hypothesize that detergency is a common but unrecognized mode of defence, which provides a base level of protection that may or may not be further enhanced by plant-derived deterrents. Our study also proves that insects ‘invented’ the use of defensive surfactants long before modern agriculture had started applying them as insecticides.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1281,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1281,unknown
159,Skin barrier structure and function: the single gel phase model,10.1038/jid.2001.1,"A new model for the structure and function of the mammalian skin barrier is postulated. It is proposed that the skin barrier, i.e., the intercellular lipid within the stratum corneum, exists as a single and coherent lamellar gel phase. This membrane structure is stabilized by the very particular lipid composition and lipid chain length distributions of the stratum corneum intercellular space and has virtually no phase boundaries. The intact, i.e., unperturbed, single and coherent lamellar gel phase is proposed to be mainly located at the lower half of stratum corneum. Further up, crystalline segregation and phase separation may occur as a result of the desquamation process. The single gel phase model differs significantly from earlier models in that it predicts that no phase separation, neither between liquid crystalline and gel phases nor between different crystalline phases with hexagonal and orthorhombic chain packing, respectively, is present in the unperturbed barrier structure. The new skin barrier model may explain: (i) the measured water permeability of stratum corneum; (ii) the particular lipid composition of the stratum corneum intercellular space; (iii) the absence of swelling of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix upon hydration; and (iv) the simultaneous presence of hexagonal and orthorhombic hydrocarbon chain packing of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix at physiologic temperatures. Further, the new model is consistent with skin barrier formation according to the membrane folding model of Norlén (2001). This new theoretical model could fully account for the extraordinary barrier capacity of mammalian skin and is hereafter referred to as the single gel phase model.",['Physically assemble/disassemble'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11676819/,pubmed,,unknown

We have investigated how these animals regulate brain temperature under heavy heat loads. Animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow, tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency (f) under full anaesthesia, whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill. At rest, brain temperature (Tbrain) rose from 38.5±0.1°C at 10°C to 39.5±0.2°C at 50°C, while f increased from ×7 to ×250 breaths min–1, with a change to open-mouth panting (OMP) at Tbrain 39.0±0.1°C, and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by 160% and 500%, respectively. OMP caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop, presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss. Angular oculi vein (AOV) flow was negligible until Tbrain reached 38.9±0.1°C, but it increased to 0.81 ml min–1 kg–1 at Tbrain 39.2±0.2°C. Bilateral occlusion of both AOVs induced OMP and a rise in Tbrain and f at Tbrain >38.8°C. We propose that reindeer regulate body and, particularly, brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting, at first through the nose, but later, when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise, primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling.",['Protect from harm'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3850,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3850.full.pdf,unknown
161,Why Do Woodpeckers Resist Head Impact Injury: A Biomechanical Investigation,,"Head injury is a leading cause of morbidity and death in both industrialized and developing countries. It is estimated that brain injuries account for 15% of the burden of fatalities and disabilities, and represent the leading cause of death in young adults. Brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and/or angular velocity of the head. However, the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of 6–7 m/s with a deceleration of 1000 g when it drums a tree trunk. It is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury. In order to investigate this, two synchronous high-speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process, and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force. The mechanical properties and macro/micro morphological structure in woodpecker's head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro-CT scanning. Finite element (FE) models of the woodpecker's head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses. The result showed that macro/micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non-impact-injuries. This biomechanical analysis makes it possible to visualize events during woodpecker pecking and may inspire new approaches to prevention and treatment of human head injury.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Physically assemble/disassemble']",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026490,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026490&type=printable,unknown

Many parts of the insect exoskeleton, such as the jumping legs of locusts, have to withstand high and repeated loading without failure. This paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach. Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle’s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m–2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage. Interestingly, insect cuticle achieves these unique properties without using reinforcement by a mineral phase, which is often found in other biological composite materials.

Most prominent is a sometimes-dramatic amount of gene loss and genome reduction. Recently, highly reduced genomes from the co-resident intracellular symbionts of sharpshooters were shown to exhibit a striking level of metabolic interdependence. One symbiont, called Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), can produce eight of the 10 essential amino acids, despite having a genome of only 245 kb. The other, Baumannia cicadellinicola (γ-Proteobacteria), can produce the remaining two essential amino acids as well as many vitamins. Cicadas also contain the symbiont Sulcia, but lack Baumannia and instead contain the co-resident symbiont Hodgkinia cicadicola (α-Proteobacteria). Here we report that, despite at least 200 million years of divergence, the two Sulcia genomes have nearly identical gene content and gene order. Additionally, we show that despite being phylogenetically distant and drastically different in genome size and architecture, Hodgkinia and Baumannia have converged on gene sets conferring similar capabilities for essential amino acid biosynthesis, in both cases precisely complementary to the pathways conserved in Sulcia. In contrast, they have completely divergent capabilities for vitamin biosynthesis. Despite having the smallest gene set known in bacteria, Hodgkinia devotes at least 7% of its proteome to cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis, a significant metabolic burden. The presence of these genes can be explained by Hodgkinia's retention of the cobalamin-dependent version of methionine synthase instead of the cobalamin-independent version found in Baumannia, a situation that necessitates retention of cobalamin biosynthetic capabilities to make the essential amino acid methionine.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/106/36/15394,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/36/15394.full.pdf,unknown

Thus, the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult. The fly Ormia ochracea possesses an unusual 'ear' that largely overcomes these physical constraints; attempts to exploit principles derived from O. ochracea for improved hearing aids are now in progress. Here we report that O. ochracea can behaviourally localize a salient sound source with a precision equal to that of humans. Despite its small size and minuscule interaural cues, the fly localizes sound sources to within 2 degrees azimuth. As the fly's eardrums are less than 0.5 mm apart, localization cues are around 50 ns. Directional information is represented in the auditory system by the relative timing of receptor responses in the two ears. Low-jitter, phasic receptor responses are pooled to achieve hyperacute timecoding. These results demonstrate that nanoscale/microscale directional microphones patterned after O. ochracea have the potential for highly accurate directional sensitivity, independent of their size.

In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (≈90°) and high wingbeat frequency (≈230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50%. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5° increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles.",['Move'],https://www.pnas.org/content/102/50/18213.full?origin=publication_detail,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/50/18213.full?origin=publication_detail.full.pdf,unknown

Here we examine the swimming kinematics, in vivo muscle dynamics and functional morphology of the force-transmission system in a lamnid shark, and show that the evolutionary convergence in body shape and mechanical design between the distantly related lamnids and tunas is much more than skin deep; it extends to the depths of the myotendinous architecture and the mechanical basis for propulsive movements.

Micro-computed tomography (microCT) was employed to create full three-dimensional images of the dorsal spines and basal plate, lateral plates, pelvic girdle and spines and to assess structural and compositional properties such as the spatial distribution of thickness (approximately 100-300 microm), the heterogeneous cross-sectional geometry (centrally thickened), plate-to-plate juncture and overlap (approximately 50% of the plate width), and bone mineral density (634-748 HA/cm(3)). The convolution of plate geometry in conjunction with plate-to-plate overlap allows a relatively constant armor thickness to be maintained throughout the assembly, promoting spatially homogeneous protection and thereby avoiding weakness at the armor unit interconnections. Plate-to-plate junctures act to register and join the plates while permitting compliance in sliding and rotation in selected directions. Mercury porosimetry was used to determine the pore size distribution and volume percent porosity of the lateral plates (20-35 vol.%) and spines (10-15 vol.%).

The evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies. At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction. Here, we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin (forward rate constant, 3,698 s−1), an exceptionally weak affinity of MgATP for myosin (association constant, 0.2 mM−1), and a unique rate-limiting step in the cross-bridge cycle at the point of inorganic phosphate release.

170,Subnanometer atomic force microscopy of peptide–mineral interactions links clustering and competition to acceleration and catastrophe,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0908205107,"In vitro observations have revealed major effects on the structure, growth, and composition of biomineral phases, including stabilization of amorphous precursors, acceleration and inhibition of kinetics, and alteration of impurity signatures. However, deciphering the mechanistic sources of these effects has been problematic due to a lack of tools to resolve molecular structures on mineral surfaces during growth. Here we report atomic force microscopy investigations using a system designed to maximize resolution while minimizing contact force. By imaging the growth of calcium-oxalate monohydrate under the influence of aspartic-rich peptides at single-molecule resolution, we reveal how the unique interactions of polypeptides with mineral surfaces lead to acceleration, inhibition, and switching of growth between two distinct states. Interaction with the positively charged face of calcium-oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film, but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well-bound state result in time-dependent effects. These include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis, characterized by rapid switching from fast to near-zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation. Interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement. The result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters. The findings have implications for control of pathological mineralization and suggest artificial strategies for directing crystallization.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/01/0908205107,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/01/0908205107.full.pdf,unknown

To date, the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures. Here, we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument. Using high-speed holographic microscopy, we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of K. veneficum and their prey, Storeatula major, within dense suspensions. The selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages, including a nontoxic one. Results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory, toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins’ potency and dosage. Even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators. The swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions, as quantified by their velocity, radii of helical trajectories, and direction of helical rotation. When mixed with prey, all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down. Furthermore, they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration, presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey. Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior. In separate experiments, we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency. Clearly, the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey, before ingesting it. These findings add a substantiated critical understanding for why some HAB species produce such complex toxin molecules.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/107/5/2082,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/5/2082.full.pdf,unknown

Thus, there is an evolutionary pay-off for these insects to adopt hydrophobic technologies, especially on contacting surfaces such as legs and wings. The cranefly is a weak flier, with many species typically found in wet/moist environments where they lay eggs. Water droplets placed on this insect's wings will spontaneously roll off the surface. In addition, the insect can stand on water bodies without its legs penetrating the water surface. The legs and wings of this insect possess thousands of tiny hairs with intricate surface topographies comprising a series of ridges running longitudinally along the long axis of the hair fibre. Here we demonstrate that this fine hair structure enhances the ability of the hairs to resist penetration into water bodies.","['Process resources', 'Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/915,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/915.full.pdf,unknown

Over a decade after the description of this organism our knowledge about the structures and strategies underlying its remarkable thermal resistance remains incipient. The accumulation of a restricted number of charged organic solutes is a common response to heat stress in hyperthermophilic organisms and accordingly their role in thermoprotection has been often postulated. In this work, the organic solute pool of P. fumarii was characterized using 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. Di-myo-inositol phosphate was the major solute (0.21 micromol/mg protein), reinforcing the correlation between the occurrence of this solute and hyperthermophily; in addition, UDP-sugars (total concentration 0.11 micromol/mg protein) were present. The structures of the two major UDP-sugars were identified as UDP-alpha-GlcNAc3NAc and UDP-alpha-GlcNAc3NAc-(4<--1)-beta-GlcpNAc3NAc. Interestingly, the latter compound appears to be derived from the first one by addition of a 2,3-N-acetylglucoronic acid unit, suggesting that these UDP-sugars are intermediates of an N-linked glycosylation pathway.

One is an actively released chemical defense: an ink secretion that is a mixture of two glandular products--ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. The mechanisms of action of ink secretion and its components have recently been examined in detail against several predatory invertebrates. Our goal is to extend this mechanistic analysis to predatory vertebrates. Toward this end, the current study details the effects of ink, opaline, and one set of its components--the products of the reaction of escapin, an l-amino acid oxidase, with its natural substrates, L-lysine and L-arginine--on the palatability of food for five species of fishes: bluehead wrasses Thalassoma bifasciatum, señorita wrasses Oxyjulis californica, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus, and bonnethead sharks Sphyrna tiburo. These fishes have different feeding styles, ranging from large fishes able to engulf sea hares to smaller fishes able to attack sea hares by pecking at them; and they live in a variety of habitats, including those that sea hares typically inhabit. We show that ink but not opaline significantly decreases the palatability of food for all five species, and that escapin products are mildly unpalatable to the two species of wrasses but not to the other species. These results, together with others, show that sea hare ink affects a diversity of predatory fishes, setting the stage for mechanistic studies using electrophysiological analysis of their chemosensory systems.","['Chemically modify', 'Protect from harm']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20570851/,pubmed,,unknown

In the past, this has been accomplished using two-dimensional planar techniques that require reconstruction of three-dimensional flow patterns. We have applied a new, fully three-dimensional, volumetric imaging technique that allows instantaneous capture of wake flow patterns, to a classic problem in functional vertebrate biology: the function of the asymmetrical (heterocercal) tail of swimming sharks to capture the vorticity field within the volume swept by the tail. These data were used to test a previous three-dimensional reconstruction of the shark vortex wake estimated from two-dimensional flow analyses, and show that the volumetric approach reveals a different vortex wake not previously reconstructed from two-dimensional slices. The hydrodynamic wake consists of one set of dual-linked vortex rings produced per half tail beat. In addition, we use a simple passive shark-tail model under robotic control to show that the three-dimensional wake flows of the robotic tail differ from the active tail motion of a live shark, suggesting that active control of kinematics and tail stiffness plays a substantial role in the production of wake vortical patterns.",['Move'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.0489,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.0489,unknown

Polaroid filter drums with stripes producing alternating e-vectors were rotated around free-moving animals. Polarized optomotor responses were displayed, and these responses were similar to those performed in response to a black-and-white, vertically-striped drum, whereas no responses were displayed to a plain polarizing control drum producing just a vertical e-vector.

Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5–20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.",['Process resources'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.2292,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.2292,unknown
180,Effect of Angle on Flow-Induced Vibrations of Pinniped Vibrissae,,"Two types of vibrissal surface structures, undulated and smooth, exist among pinnipeds. Most Phocidae have vibrissae with undulated surfaces, while Otariidae, Odobenidae, and a few phocid species possess vibrissae with smooth surfaces. Variations in cross-sectional profile and orientation of the vibrissae also exist between pinniped species. These factors may influence the way that the vibrissae behave when exposed to water flow. This study investigated the effect that vibrissal surface structure and orientation have on flow-induced vibrations of pinniped vibrissae. Laser vibrometry was used to record vibrations along the whisker shaft from the undulated vibrissae of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and the smooth vibrissae of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). Vibrations along the whisker shaft were measured in a flume tank, at three orientations (0°, 45°, 90°) to the water flow. The results show that vibration frequency and velocity ranges were similar for both undulated and smooth vibrissae. Angle of orientation, rather than surface structure, had the greatest effect on flow-induced vibrations. Vibration velocity was up to 60 times higher when the wide, flat aspect of the whisker faced into the flow (90°), compared to when the thin edge faced into the flow (0°). Vibration frequency was also dependent on angle of orientation. Peak frequencies were measured up to 270 Hz and were highest at the 0° orientation for all whiskers. Furthermore, CT scanning was used to quantify the three-dimensional structure of pinniped vibrissae that may influence flow interactions. The CT data provide evidence that all vibrissae are flattened in cross-section to some extent and that differences exist in the orientation of this profile with respect to the major curvature of the hair shaft. These data support the hypothesis that a compressed cross-sectional profile may play a key role in reducing self-noise of the vibrissae.",['Move'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069872,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069872&type=printable,unknown

Herein we show that the natural quill’s geometry enables easy penetration and high tissue adhesion where the barbs specifically contribute to adhesion and unexpectedly, dramatically reduce the force required to penetrate tissue. Reduced penetration force is achieved by topography that appears to create stress concentrations along regions of the quill where the cross sectional diameter grows rapidly, facilitating cutting of the tissue. Barbs located near the first geometrical transition zone exhibit the most substantial impact on minimizing the force required for penetration. Barbs at the tip of the quill independently exhibit the greatest impact on tissue adhesion force and the cooperation between barbs in the 0–2 mm and 2–4 mm regions appears critical to enhance tissue adhesion force. The dual functions of barbs were reproduced with replica molded synthetic polyurethane quills. These findings should serve as the basis for the development of bio-inspired devices such as tissue adhesives or needles, trocars, and vascular tunnelers where minimizing the penetration force is important to prevent collateral damage.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Move']",https://www.pnas.org/content/109/52/21289,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/109/52/21289.full.pdf,unknown

This protein, which we call `escapin', has highsequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. Escapin was verifiedby NMR, mass spectroscopy and HPLC to have FAD as its flavin cofactor.Escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, weredetermined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria onsolid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation ofzones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation ofbacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing onagar plates. Native escapin inhibited the growth of Gram-positive andGram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (Vibrio harveyiiand Staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria(Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes andPseudomonas aeruginosa). Escapin also inhibited the growth of yeastand fungi, with different efficacies. Escapin's antimicrobial activity wasconcentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5months at room temperature. Escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal inminimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of20 amino acids each at 50 μmol l-1, but was bactericidal inmedia enriched with Tryptone Peptone. Escapin was also strongly bactericidalin media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmoll-1 and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l-1l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmoll-1. Escapin had high oxidase activity (producing hydrogenperoxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as asubstrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-aminoacids. Hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was stronglybacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect tol-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presenceof escapin. Together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanismsto escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely orentirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's LAAOactivity, but bactericidal effects resulting from lysine-dependent mechanismsnot directly involving hydrogen peroxide. Recombinant escapin expressed inbacteria was also active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.",['Protect from harm'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/18/3609.abstract,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/18/3609.full.pdf,unknown

The results suggest that liftenhancement during clap-and-fling requires an angular separation between thetwo wings of no more than 10–12°. Within the limitations of therobotic apparatus, the clap-and-fling augmented total lift production by up to17%, but depended strongly on stroke kinematics. The time course of theinteraction between the wings was quite complex. For example, wing interactionattenuated total force during the initial part of the wing clap, but slightlyenhanced force at the end of the clap phase. We measured two temporallytransient peaks of both lift and drag enhancement during the fling phase: aprominent peak during the initial phase of the fling motion, which accountsfor most of the benefit in lift production, and a smaller peak of forceenhancement at the end fling when the wings started to move apart. A detaileddigital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) analysis during clap-and-flingshowed that the most obvious effect of the bilateral `image' wing on flowoccurs during the early phase of the fling, due to a strong fluid influxbetween the wings as they separate. The DPIV analysis revealed, moreover, thatcirculation induced by a leading edge vortex (LEV) during the early flingphase was smaller than predicted by inviscid two-dimensional analyticalmodels, whereas circulation of LEV nearly matched the predictions ofWeis-Fogh's inviscid model at late fling phase. In addition, the presence ofthe image wing presumably causes subtle modifications in both the wake captureand viscous forces. Collectively, these effects explain some of the changes intotal force and lift production during the fling. Quite surprisingly, theeffect of clap-and-fling is not restricted to the dorsal part of the strokecycle but extends to the beginning of upstroke, suggesting that the presenceof the image wing distorts the gross wake structure throughout the strokecycle.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/16/3075,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/16/3075.full.pdf,unknown

The responses of the pupil of a nocturnal gecko (Gekko gekko) to external light stimulus were studied. 2. The responses of the pupil are determined by light entering the pupil and not by light acting directly on the iris. 3. The responses of the pupil are very uniform in sensitivity including spectral sensitivity for light coming in different directions to the eye. 4. The possible change in area of the pupil is more than 300-fold and probably represents an effort to shield the pure rod retina from saturating light intensities. 5. The pupil continues to contract sharply for changes in external light intensity which give retinal illuminations corresponding to 10(6) quanta/sec. striking a retinal rod. 6. There is a large degree of spatial summation of the response; circular external light fields subtending 5 and 140 degrees giving the same illumination at the pupil give approximately the same pupil response. 7.

A major challenge is to understand how a biological thermometer processes thermal information to optimize cellular functions. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we show that the thermosensitive histidine kinase, DesK, from Bacillus subtilis is cold-activated through specific interhelical rearrangements in its central four-helix bundle domain. As revealed by the crystal structures of DesK in different functional states, the plasticity of this helical domain influences the catalytic activities of the protein, either by modifying the mobility of the ATP-binding domains for autokinase activity or by modulating binding of the cognate response regulator to sustain the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities. The structural and biochemical data suggest a model in which the transmembrane sensor domain of DesK promotes these structural changes through conformational signals transmitted by the membrane-connecting two-helical coiled-coil, ultimately controlling the alternation between output autokinase and phosphatase activities. The structural comparison of the different DesK variants indicates that incoming signals can take the form of helix rotations and asymmetric helical bends similar to those reported for other sensing systems, suggesting that a similar switching mechanism could be operational in a wide range of sensor histidine kinases.",['Process information'],https://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16185,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16185.full.pdf,unknown

Locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein, resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage. In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles.

These glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side, presumably for intraspecific signaling. A few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering, white scales that also enhance the blue/green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1731,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1731.full.pdf,unknown
191,Simulating ozone detoxification in the leaf apoplast through the direct reaction with ascorbate,10.1007/PL00008153,"This paper presents a mathematical model which enables the semi-quantification of ozone (O3) detoxification, based upon the direct reaction of the pollutant with ascorbate (ASC) located in the aqueous matrix associated with the cell wall (i.e. the apoplast). The model describes the uptake of ozone into the leaf and its direct reaction with ASC, taking into consideration the regeneration of dehydroascorbic acid in the cytosol, the rate of replenishment of cell wall ASC and the distribution of ASC between sub-cellular compartments based upon the permeability of biomembranes to the neutral species, ascorbic acid and the pH of various sub-cellular compartments. The importance of various physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. stomatal conductance, mesophyll cell wall thickness and tortuosity, chloroplast volume, apoplast pH, ASC:O3 reaction stoichiometry) in mediating the flux of ozone to the plasmalemma is analysed. Model simulations, supported by experimental observations, suggest that the ASC concentration in the leaf apoplast is high enough to scavenge a significant proportion of the O3 taken up into the leaf interior, under environmentally relevant conditions. However, there is considerable variation between taxa in the potential degree of protection afforded by apoplastic ASC, emphasizing the need for an improved understanding of the reaction chemistry of O3 in the cell wall.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10750904/,pubmed,,unknown

In shell constructions, joints between individual elements are considered as weak points, yet these echinoid skeletons show an extensive preservation potential in both Recent and fossil environments. The remarkable strength of the test is achieved by skeletal reinforcement structures and their constructional layouts. Micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy are used for microstructural and volumetric analyses of the echinoid's skeleton. It is shown that strengthening mechanisms act on different hierarchical levels from the overall shape of the skeleton to skeletal interlocking. The tight-fitting and interlocking plate joints lead to a shell considered to behave as a monolithic structure. The plate's architecture features distinct regions interpreted as a significant load-transferring system. The internal support system follows the segmentation of the remaining skeleton, where sutural layout and stereom distribution are designed for effective load transfer. The structural analysis of the multi-plated, yet monolithic skeleton of Echinocyamus pusillus reveals new aspects of the micro-morphology and its structural relevance for the load-bearing behaviour. The analysed structural principles allow E. pusillus to be considered as a role model for the development of multi-element, light-weight shell constructions.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.171323,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.171323,unknown

during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)",10.1242/jeb.002071,"Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursorto powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics ofgliding in living animals. In this study I analyzed the 3D kinematics of sugargliders (Petaurus breviceps) during short glides in an enclosedspace. Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positionsof marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances andangles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the wholebody accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by theanimals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and bodyrotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, Icompared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized anddistantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). Thesugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0±0.5 ms–2), and also accelerated forward (2.1±0.6 ms–2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weightwas not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the liftproduced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. Thegliders used high angles of attack (44.15±3.12°), far higher thanthe angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher liftcoefficients (1.48±0.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing.Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations,suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to controltheir orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals,different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation,suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations.Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficientsand lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginallyshallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphologicalspecializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain theirgreater lift generating performance.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/15/2593,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/15/2593.full.pdf,unknown

The major structuraldifference between the two secretions is the presence of specific proteins inthe adhesive mucus. The present study identifies similar proteins from theglue of the slug Arion subfuscus and the land snail Helixaspersa. To investigate the role played by these proteins in adhesion,the proteins were isolated from the adhesive mucus of different molluscs andadded to commercial polymer solutions. The effect was observed qualitatively,and quantified using a dynamic rheometer. The isolated proteins triggeredgelling or visible stiffening of agar, pectin and polygalacturonic acid. Theeffect was stronger on more negatively charged polymers. The effect of theproteins was concentration dependent with an optimal concentration of1–1.5 mg ml–1, and was weakened when their structurechanged. Other proteins and carbohydrates found in the adhesive mucus had noclear mechanical effect on gels. These findings show that the addition ofthese proteins to large, anionic polymers plays a central role in theformation of a glue from a mucus-like secretion.

We report the surprising observation that Bacillus subtilis biofilm colonies and pellicles are extremely nonwetting, greatly surpassing the repellency of Teflon toward water and lower surface tension liquids. The biofilm surface remains nonwetting against up to 80% ethanol as well as other organic solvents and commercial biocides across a large and clinically important concentration range. We show that this property limits the penetration of antimicrobial liquids into the biofilm, severely compromising their efficacy. To highlight the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we performed experiments with mutant biofilms lacking ECM components and with functionalized polymeric replicas of biofilm microstructure. We show that the nonwetting properties are a synergistic result of ECM composition, multiscale roughness, reentrant topography, and possibly yet other factors related to the dynamic nature of the biofilm surface. Finally, we report the impenetrability of the biofilm surface by gases, implying defense capability against vapor-phase antimicrobials as well. These remarkable properties of B. subtilis biofilm, which may have evolved as a protection mechanism against native environmental threats, provide a new direction in both antimicrobial research and bioinspired liquid-repellent surface paradigms.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/3/995,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/3/995.full.pdf,unknown

An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Process information']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19179529/,pubmed,,unknown
201,Filtration of submicrometer particles by pelagic tunicates,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003599107,"Salps are common in oceanic waters and have higher per-individual filtration rates than any other zooplankton filter feeder. Although salps are centimeters in length, feeding via particle capture occurs on a fine, mucous mesh (fiber diameter d ∼0.1 μm) at low velocity (U = 1.6 ± 0.6 cm·s−1, mean ± SD) and is thus a low Reynolds-number (Re ∼10−3) process. In contrast to the current view that particle encounter is dictated by simple sieving of particles larger than the mesh spacing, a low-Re mathematical model of encounter rates by the salp feeding apparatus for realistic oceanic particle-size distributions shows that submicron particles, due to their higher abundances, are encountered at higher rates (particles per time) than larger particles. Data from feeding experiments with 0.5-, 1-, and 3-μm diameter polystyrene spheres corroborate these findings. Although particles larger than 1 μm (e.g., flagellates, small diatoms) represent a larger carbon pool, smaller particles in the 0.1- to 1-μm range (e.g., bacteria, Prochlorococcus) may be more quickly digestible because they present more surface area, and we find that particles smaller than the mesh size (1.4 μm) can fully satisfy salp energetic needs. Furthermore, by packaging submicrometer particles into rapidly sinking fecal pellets, pelagic tunicates can substantially change particle-size spectra and increase downward fluxes in the ocean.",['Process resources'],https://www.pnas.org/content/107/34/15129,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/34/15129.full.pdf,unknown

Pigment cells are interesting for biosensing purposes since they provide an easily monitored physiological phenomenon. Melanophores, containing dark brown melanin pigment granules, constitute an important class of chromatophores. Their melanin-filled pigment granules may be stimulated to undergo rapid dispersion throughout the melanophores (cells appear dark), or aggregation to the center of the melanophores (cells appear light). This simple physiological response can easily be measured in a photometer. Selected G protein coupled receptors can be functionally expressed in cultured frog melanophores. Here, we demonstrate the use of recombinant frog melanophores as a biosensor for the detection of opioids. Melanophores were transfected with the human opioid receptor 3 and used for opiate detection. The response to the opioid receptor agonist morphine and a synthetic opioid peptide was analyzed by absorbance readings in an aggregation assay. It was shown that both agonists caused aggregation of pigment granules in the melanophores, and the cells appeared lighter. The pharmacology of the expressed receptors was very similar to its mammalian counterpart, as evidenced by competitive inhibition by increasing concentrations of the opioid receptor inhibitor naloxone. Transfection of melanophores with selected receptors enables the creation of numerous melanophore biosensors, which respond selectively to certain substances. The melanophore biosensor has potential use for measurement of substances in body fluids such as saliva, blood plasma and urine.","['Protect from harm', 'Change size or color']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11849930/,pubmed,,unknown

In contrast, for numerous human pathogens their biological activity in niches outside of medical contexts is well-known. Whereas there is increasing evidence that traits fostering survival in 'environmental' niches can be the basis for virulence factors of human pathogens, niches for plant pathogenic bacteria outside of plants or of agricultural settings have not been elucidated. Most phytopathogenic bacteria are not obligate parasites, some of them can be transported to altitudes of several kilometres, they are scrubbed from the atmosphere by rainfall, and thus they are presumably transported to and might survive in a wide range of habitats. We isolated Pseudomonas syringae from river epilithon (rock-attached biofilms composed of algae, diatoms, rotifers, bacteria and nematodes) at densities up to 6000 cells g(-1) in France and the USA, some in pristine settings where waters flowed directly from snow melt and had not passed through agricultural zones. These strains induced hypersensitivity in indicator plants (tobacco) suggesting the presence of functional pathogenicity systems, and many induced disease in 1-7 of the plant species tested and produced a syringomycin-like toxin. Strains also were resistant to some antibiotics used to control plant diseases but not to copper sulphate. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of epilithon strains and of reference strains of P. syringae revealed that a genetic lineage containing the strains with the broadest host range was distributed across several continents. Is it likely that wide spread dissemination of P. syringae occurs via aerosols and precipitation. This work highlights our limited understanding of non-agricultural niches in the ecology and evolution of plant pathogenic bacteria, of their role in the development of agricultural epidemics both as sources of inoculum and as sources of novel traits that may enhance bacterial pathogenicity and fitness.",[],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16807133/,pubmed,,unknown

Incorporating afive-segment, 17 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) kinematic model of the ostrich hindlimb developed from anatomical specimens, we quantified the three-dimensional(3-D) joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running (at ∼3.3 ms–1) in the largest avian biped, the ostrich. Our analysisrevealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrichoccurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of theaverage flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotatedexternally to the direction of travel (37° and 21°, respectively) sothat pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct thetibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extensionat the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to theplane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide themajor lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary forsteering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what wouldotherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/externalrotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry andneuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints'non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. Inparticular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motionmay further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantialnon-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance.Measurement of 3-D segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the useof functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes, provingimportant when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avianbipedalism.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/14/2548,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/14/2548.full.pdf,unknown

208,Evidence for an elastic projection mechanism in the chameleon tongue,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2003.2637,"To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s⊃–2. At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high–speed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg⊃–1 are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five– to 10–fold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High–speed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy–storage–and–release mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective–tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg⊃–1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding–spring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection. The release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of 10 because the elastic–energy release occurs much faster than the loading process. Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Move']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2003.2637,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2003.2637,unknown
209,Water relations of tetrapod integument,10.1242/jeb.02007,"The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between theneeds for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment andregulating the exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as ameans of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing astructural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier tocutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamentalimportance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in manycases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity offunction. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very littlekeratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that arepresent in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external tothe epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratincomplex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of theepidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from asuperficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding thestratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebratesgenerally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have`plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it isclear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account forcovariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studiesof the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamentalmechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrierthickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids,and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipidshave been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics,relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrierontogenesis related to adaptation and environment.

210,Bone density and the lightweight skeletons of birds,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,"The skeletons of birds are universally described as lightweight as a result of selection for minimizing the energy required for flight. From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes. By analogy, increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume. These data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight. They also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate, yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals.","['Move', 'Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Maintain structural integrity', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,unknown

This arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded (approximately 1,000,000 rods mm(-2)) in any vertebrate eye. Cone photoreceptors are, however, present in low numbers. The eye is relatively small (axial length 16.1+/-0.2 mm) with a maximum pupil diameter of 9.0+/-0.0 mm, achieving a light-gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird (f-number approximately 1.07). The binocular field has a maximum width of 38 degrees and extends vertically through 100 degrees with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery; a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position. We propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution. Thus, while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum, visual resolution must be low. This explains why these birds employ other sensory cues, including olfaction and echolocation, in the control of their behaviour in low-light-level environments.","['Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Process information']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14740100/,pubmed,,unknown
212,Modelling of the frictional behaviour of the snake skin covered by anisotropic surface nanostructures,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep23539,"Previous experimental data clearly revealed anisotropic friction on the ventral scale surface of snakes. However, it is known that frictional properties of the ventral surface of the snake skin range in a very broad range and the degree of anisotropy ranges as well to a quite strong extent. This might be due to the variety of species studied, diversity of approaches used for the friction characterization, and/or due to the variety of substrates used as a counterpart in the experiments. In order to understand the interactions between the nanostructure arrays of the ventral surface of the snake skin, this study was undertaken, which is aimed at numerical modeling of frictional properties of the structurally anisotropic surfaces in contact with various size of asperities. The model shows that frictional anisotropy appears on the snake skin only on the substrates with a characteristic range of roughness, which is less or comparable with dimensions of the skin microstructure. In other words, scale of the skin relief should reflect an adaptation to the particular range of surfaces asperities of the substrate.",['Move'],https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23539,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23539.pdf,unknown
213,Prevalence and Evolution of Core Photosystem II Genes in Marine Cyanobacterial Viruses and Their Hosts,,"Cyanophages (cyanobacterial viruses) are important agents of horizontal gene transfer among marine cyanobacteria, the numerically dominant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans. Some cyanophage genomes carry and express host-like photosynthesis genes, presumably to augment the host photosynthetic machinery during infection. To study the prevalence and evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon, 33 cultured cyanophages of known family and host range and viral DNA from field samples were screened for the presence of two core photosystem reaction center genes, 					psbA and 					psbD. Combining this expanded dataset with published data for nine other cyanophages, we found that 88% of the phage genomes contain 					psbA, and 50% contain both 					psbA and 					psbD. The 					psbA gene was found in all myoviruses and 					Prochlorococcus podoviruses, but could not be amplified from 					Prochlorococcus siphoviruses or 					Synechococcus podoviruses. Nearly all of the phages that encoded both 					psbA and 					psbD had broad host ranges. We speculate that the presence or absence of 					psbA in a phage genome may be determined by the length of the latent period of infection. Whether it also carries 					psbD may reflect constraints on coupling of viral- and host-encoded PsbA–PsbD in the photosynthetic reaction center across divergent hosts. Phylogenetic clustering patterns of these genes from cultured phages suggest that whole genes have been transferred from host to phage in a discrete number of events over the course of evolution (four for 					psbA, and two for 					psbD), followed by horizontal and vertical transfer between cyanophages. Clustering patterns of 					psbA and 					psbD from 					Synechococcus cells were inconsistent with other molecular phylogenetic markers, suggesting genetic exchanges involving 					Synechococcus lineages. Signatures of intragenic recombination, detected within the cyanophage gene pool as well as between hosts and phages in both directions, support this hypothesis. The analysis of cyanophage 					psbA and 					psbD genes from field populations revealed significant sequence diversity, much of which is represented in our cultured isolates. Collectively, these findings show that photosynthesis genes are common in cyanophages and that significant genetic exchanges occur from host to phage, phage to host, and within the phage gene pool. This generates genetic diversity among the phage, which serves as a reservoir for their hosts, and in turn influences photosystem evolution.",[],https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040234,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040234&type=printable,unknown
214,Magnetoreception System in Honeybees (Apis mellifera),,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) undergo iron biomineralization, providing the basis for magnetoreception. We showed earlier the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in iron granules formed in honeybees, and subscribed to the notion that external magnetic fields may cause expansion or contraction of the superparamagnetic particles in an orientation-specific manner, relaying the signal via cytoskeleton (Hsu and Li 1994). In this study, we established a size-density purification procedure, with which quantitative amount of iron granules was obtained from honey bee trophocytes and characterized; the density of iron granules was determined to be 1.25 g/cm3. While we confirmed the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in the iron granules, we observed changes in the size of the magnetic granules in the trophycytes upon applying additional magnetic field to the cells. A concomitant release of calcium ion was observed by confocal microscope. This size fluctuation triggered the increase of intracellular Ca+2 , which was inhibited by colchicines and latrunculin B, known to be blockers for microtubule and microfilament syntheses, respectively. The associated cytoskeleton may thus relay the magnetosignal, initiating a neural response. A model for the mechanism of magnetoreception in honeybees is proposed, which may be applicable to most, if not all, magnetotactic organisms.",['Process information'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000395,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000395&type=printable,unknown
215,Evidence for a vertebrate catapult: elastic energy storage in the plantaris tendon during frog jumping,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0982,"Anuran jumping is one of the most powerful accelerations in vertebrate locomotion. Several species are hypothesized to use a catapult-like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy, producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle. Most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole-body power output; the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult-like mechanism has not been demonstrated. We used high-speed marker-based biplanar X-ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism: (i) shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement (during tendon stretch), and (ii) rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle-shortening (during tendon recoil). During all jumps, muscle fascicles shortened by an average of 7.8 per cent (54% of total strain) prior to joint movement, stretching the tendon. The subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change, consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon. These data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping, and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub-maximal jumps.","['Move', 'Process resources']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0982,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0982,unknown
216,The Advantages of a Tapered Whisker,,"The role of facial vibrissae (whiskers) in the behavior of terrestrial mammals is principally as a supplement or substitute for short-distance vision. Each whisker in the array functions as a mechanical transducer, conveying forces applied along the shaft to mechanoreceptors in the follicle at the whisker base. Subsequent processing of mechanoreceptor output in the trigeminal nucleus and somatosensory cortex allows high accuracy discriminations of object distance, direction, and surface texture. The whiskers of terrestrial mammals are tapered and approximately circular in cross section. We characterize the taper of whiskers in nine mammal species, measure the mechanical deflection of isolated felid whiskers, and discuss the mechanics of a single whisker under static and oscillatory deflections. We argue that a tapered whisker provides some advantages for tactile perception (as compared to a hypothetical untapered whisker), and that this may explain why the taper has been preserved during the evolution of terrestrial mammals.",['Process information'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008806,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008806&type=printable,unknown

This fluid is an emulsion, consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase. The detailed function of its two-phasic nature has remained unclear. Here we show that the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates. We discovered that it is possible to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component. While thick layers of polyimide spin-coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets, thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form. Force measurements of stick insect pads sliding on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces. Artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates, confirming that the effect is caused by the insects’ fluid-based adhesive system. Our findings suggest that insect adhesive pads use emulsions with non-Newtonian properties, which may have been optimized by natural selection. Emulsions as adhesive secretions combine the benefits of ‘wet’ adhesion and resistance against shear forces.",['Attach'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2009.0308,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2009.0308,unknown

Weapplied this evolutionary concept to barnacle cement polymerization, a processcritical to barnacle fitness that involves aggregation and cross-linking ofproteins. The biochemical mechanisms of cement polymerization remain largelyunknown. We hypothesized that this process is biochemically similar to bloodclotting, a critical physiological response that is also based on aggregationand cross-linking of proteins. Like key elements of vertebrate andinvertebrate blood clotting, barnacle cement polymerization was shown toinvolve proteolytic activation of enzymes and structural precursors,transglutaminase cross-linking and assembly of fibrous proteins. Proteolyticactivation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bondinginteractions with other proteins and with the surface. Transglutaminasecross-linking reinforces cement integrity. Remarkably, epitopes and sequenceshomologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified inbarnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and/or western blotting. Akin toblood clotting, the peptides generated during proteolytic activationfunctioned as signal molecules, linking a molecular level event (proteinaggregation) to a behavioral response (barnacle larval settlement). Ourresults draw attention to a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanismand shed light on a long-standing biochemical puzzle.

220,Ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure facilitate deep dives and cold water foraging in adult leatherback sea turtles,10.1242/jeb.034991,"Adult leatherbacks are large animals (300–500 kg), overlapping insize with marine pinniped and cetacean species. Unlike marine mammals, theystart their aquatic life as 40–50 g hatchlings, so undergo a 10,000-foldincrease in body mass during independent existence. Hatchlings are limited tothe tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinousplankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and aregigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water.This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in trachealstructure related to diving and exposure to cold. Hatchling leatherbacks havea conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous ringsinterspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almostcontinuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, andwill collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thusavoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems. It is linedwith an extensive, dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidifycold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration. A sub-luminallymphatic plexus is also present.

When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size).

We analyzed the movements of 39 specimens of S. purpuratus after they were placed in the center of a featureless tank containing a round, black target that had an angular diameter of 6.5 deg. or 10 deg. (solid angles of 0.01 sr and 0.024 sr, respectively). An average orientation vector for each urchin was determined by testing the animal four times, with the target placed successively at bearings of 0 deg., 90 deg., 180 deg. and 270 deg. (relative to magnetic east). The urchins showed no significant unimodal or axial orientation relative to any non-target feature of the environment or relative to the changing position of the 6.5 deg. target. However, the urchins were strongly axially oriented relative to the changing position of the 10 deg. target (mean axis from –1 to 179 deg.; 95% confidence interval ± 12 deg.; P<0.001, Moore's non-parametric Hotelling's test), with 10 of the 20 urchins tested against that target choosing an average bearing within 10 deg. of either the target center or its opposite direction (two would be expected by chance). In addition, the average length of the 20 target-normalized bearings for the 10 deg. target (each the vector sum of the bearings for the four trials) were far higher than would be expected by chance (P<10−10; Monte Carlo simulation), showing that each urchin, whether it moved towards or away from the target, did so with high consistency. These results strongly suggest that S. purpuratus detected the 10 deg. target, responding either by approaching it or fleeing it. Given that the urchins did not appear to respond to the 6.5 deg. target, it is likely that the 10 deg. target was close to the minimum detectable size for this species. Interestingly, measurements of the spine density of the regions of the test that faced horizontally predicted a similar visual resolution (8.3±0.5 deg. for the interambulacrum and 11±0.54 deg. for the ambulacrum). The function of this relatively low, but functional, acuity – on par with that of the chambered Nautilus and the horseshoe crab – is unclear but, given the bimodal response, is likely to be related to both shelter seeking and predator avoidance.",['Process information'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/249,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/249.full.pdf,unknown

We measured the gradient in oxygen partial pressure(PO2) away from the snouts of buried echidnasand oxygen consumption(V̇O2) in fiveindividuals under similar conditions, in two substrates with differentair-filled porosities (fa). A theoretical diffusion modelindicated that diffusion alone was insufficient to account for the flux ofoxygen required to meet measured rates ofV̇O2. However, itwas noticed that echidnas often showed periodic movements of the anterior partof the body, as if such movements were a deliberate effort to flush the tidalair space surrounding their nostrils. These `flushing movements' weresubsequently found to temporarily increase the levels of interstitial oxygenin the soil around the head region. Flushing movements were more frequentwhile V̇O2 washigher during the burrowing process, and also in substrate with lowerfa. We conclude that oxygen supply to buried echidnas ismaintained by diffusion through the soil augmented by periodic flushingmovements, which ventilate the tidal airspace that surrounds the nostrils.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/5/938,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/5/938.full.pdf,unknown

This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of ‘listening in’ and ‘broadcasting to’ unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom.

226,RIN4 Functions with Plasma Membrane H+-ATPases to Regulate Stomatal Apertures during Pathogen Attack,,"Pathogen perception by the plant innate immune system is of central importance to plant survival and productivity. The Arabidopsis protein RIN4 is a negative regulator of plant immunity. In order to identify additional proteins involved in RIN4-mediated immune signal transduction, we purified components of the RIN4 protein complex. We identified six novel proteins that had not previously been implicated in RIN4 signaling, including the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPases AHA1 and/or AHA2. RIN4 interacts with AHA1 and AHA2 both in vitro and in vivo. RIN4 overexpression and knockout lines exhibit differential PM H+-ATPase activity. PM H+-ATPase activation induces stomatal opening, enabling bacteria to gain entry into the plant leaf; inactivation induces stomatal closure thus restricting bacterial invasion. The rin4 knockout line exhibited reduced PM H+-ATPase activity and, importantly, its stomata could not be re-opened by virulent Pseudomonas syringae. We also demonstrate that RIN4 is expressed in guard cells, highlighting the importance of this cell type in innate immunity.

Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure.

Although biosynthesis of the various activated precursors (for example, nucleoside diphosphate sugars and hydroxyacyl-CoA thioesters) is well understood, the molecular mechanisms of polymerisation and, when relevant, secretion remain elusive.A central goal in the field is to obtain a deeper understanding of the operation and three-dimensional architecture of polymerases and synthases, or the respective polymerisation and secretion multiprotein complexes, in order to increase the efficiency of engineering experiments. Random mutagenesis approaches have already proved to be successful, generating biosynthesis enzymes with a change in substrate specificity and activity and enabling the efficient production of modified polymers.The increasing knowledge with respect to biosynthesis pathways and key biosynthesis enzymes has enabled metabolic engineering and protein engineering, leading to the production of modified and new polymers with unique and valuable material properties. These engineering approaches are informed by recent advances in the analysis of the polymer structure–material property relationship.Aside from the possibility of easily engineering bacterial production hosts for the production of modified polymers, in vitro enzymatic and chemical modifications offer additional design space to the manufacture of bacterial polymers. The purification of polymerases and synthases or subcellular fractions containing the respective enzyme activities from bacteria allows controlled processive in vitro synthesis of defined polymers.Whereas several bacterial exopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyalkanoates are already commercially produced, the polyamides and polyphosphates are not commercially produced by bacterial fermentation. However, recent advances in polyamide biosynthesis hold promise for future commercial synthesis.The economics of the bacterial production of polymers is largely driven by the cost of the precursor substrate, the productivity of the host organisms, the upstream and downstream processing costs and the application value of the polymer. In addition, when bacterial polymers such as the polyhydroxyalkanoates compete with oil-based polymers, crude oil prices substantially affect polymer economics.Notable progress has been made in all of the areas mentioned above, and exploitation of metabolic engineering in particular has led to the generation of exciting new production hosts able to synthesize even unnatural polymers such as polythioesters and polylactic acid. An interesting new development considers the intracellularly formed spherical polyhydroxyalkanoate granules as versatile biobeads, the surface proteins of which can be engineered to display a range of protein functions for applications in bioseparation, protein production, biocatalysis, diagnostics and antigen delivery.",[],https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2354,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2354.pdf,unknown
235,FM echolocating bats shift frequencies to avoid broadcast–echo ambiguity in clutter,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1000429107,"Sonar broadcasts are followed by echoes at different delays from objects at different distances. When broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings, echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts. To identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter, echolocating bats that emit multiple-harmonic FM sounds were trained to fly into a dense, extended array of obstacles (multiple rows of vertically hanging chains) while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat. Flight paths were reconstructed from thermal-infrared video recordings. Successive rows of chains extended more than 6 m in depth, so each broadcast was followed by a series of echoes from multiple rows of chains that lasted up to 40 ms. Bats emitted sounds in pairs (“strobe groups”) at short (20–40 ms) interpulse intervals (IPIs) alternating with longer IPIs (>50 ms). For many short IPIs, the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted. This overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts. Bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by 3–6 kHz. When overlap and ambiguity ceased, frequency shifts ceased also. Frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band, which was 75–80 kHz wide, but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms. Bats could use time–frequency comparisons of echoes with broadcasts to assign echoes to the corresponding broadcasts and thus avoid ambiguity.",[],https://www.pnas.org/content/107/15/7048,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/15/7048.full.pdf,unknown

Phenotypes exhibited at various stages during the development of the axial skeleton may play a key role in testing mechanisms recently proposed to explain this conservatism. Here, we provide osteogenetic data that identify developmental criteria with which to recognize cervical vs. noncervical vertebrae in mammals. Except for sloths, all mammals show the late ossification of the caudal-most centra in the neck after other centra and neural arches. In sloths with 8–10 ribless neck vertebrae, the caudal-most neck centra ossify early, matching the pattern observed in cranial thoracic vertebrae of other mammals. Accordingly, we interpret the ribless neck vertebrae of three-toed sloths caudal to V7 as thoracic based on our developmental criterion. Applied to the unusual vertebral phenotype of long-necked sloths, these data support the interpretation that elements of the axial skeleton with origins from distinct mesodermal tissues have repatterned over the course of evolution.",['Physically assemble/disassemble'],https://www.pnas.org/content/107/44/18903.full,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/44/18903.full.pdf,unknown

This damage is resulting from warmer and drier summers associated with climate change. To test whether defoliated IDF can directly transfer resources to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosae) regenerating nearby, thus aiding in forest recovery, we examined photosynthetic carbon transfer and defense enzyme response. We grew pairs of ectomycorrhizal IDF ‘donor’ and ponderosa pine ‘receiver’ seedlings in pots and isolated transfer pathways by comparing 35 μm, 0.5 μm and no mesh treatments; we then stressed IDF donors either through manual defoliation or infestation by the budworm. We found that manual defoliation of IDF donors led to transfer of photosynthetic carbon to neighboring receivers through mycorrhizal networks, but not through soil or root pathways. Both manual and insect defoliation of donors led to increased activity of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and superoxide dismutase in the ponderosa pine receivers, via a mechanism primarily dependent on the mycorrhizal network. These findings indicate that IDF can transfer resources and stress signals to interspecific neighbors, suggesting ectomycorrhizal networks can serve as agents of interspecific communication facilitating recovery and succession of forests after disturbance.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08495,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08495.pdf,unknown

during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)",10.1242/jeb.002071,"Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursorto powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics ofgliding in living animals. In this study I analyzed the 3D kinematics of sugargliders (Petaurus breviceps) during short glides in an enclosedspace. Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positionsof marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances andangles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the wholebody accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by theanimals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and bodyrotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, Icompared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized anddistantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). Thesugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0±0.5 ms–2), and also accelerated forward (2.1±0.6 ms–2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weightwas not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the liftproduced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. Thegliders used high angles of attack (44.15±3.12°), far higher thanthe angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher liftcoefficients (1.48±0.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing.Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations,suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to controltheir orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals,different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation,suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations.Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficientsand lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginallyshallower glides.

These structures are often supplemented with microtrichia fields of the inner surface of the elytra and adjacent parts of the pterothorax. The present study provides information about the ultrastructure of microtrichia of the dorso-medial fields of the thorax (TDM) in tenebrionid beetles (Tribolium castaneum, Zophobas rugipes). Epidermal cells located under the TDM field contain large electron-lucent vesicles connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum. Microtrichia and underlying cuticle of the TDM have a high density of pore channels, which are responsible for transport of an epidermal secretion onto the TDM surface. In order to show the presence of the secretion on the cuticle surface, TDM fields of air-dried specimens were compared with those in specimens after two treatments, such as (1) dehydration in ethanol and acetone, and (2) dental-wax-cast technique applied to living beetles. This revealed the presence of the nonvolatile film on the intact microtrichial surface. Possible functions of this film are suggested to be (1) the increase of adhesive forces in the contact area and (2) providing soft coupling and release of two corresponding parts of the elytra-locking device.

242,A novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue,10.1242/jeb.044149,"The dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness. Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue. Its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin, meaning that it is a polypeptide, and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was 2.4 kDa.",[],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3416,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3416.full.pdf,unknown

The mechanical properties along the leaflet vary with the degree of pigmentation. Pigmented regions of the valve leaflet that contain melanocytes displayed higher storage modulus (7–10 GPa) than non-pigmented areas (2.5–4 GPa).

Here, we present evidence from single-toe force measurements, laser tweezer microrheometry of pad mucus and interference reflection microscopy of the contact zone in Litoria caerulea, that tree frog attachment forces are significantly enhanced by close contacts and boundary friction between the pad epidermis and the substrate, facilitated by the highly regular pad microstructure.","['Attach', 'Protect from harm']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2006.0135,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2006.0135,unknown

It creates a dome-shaped web between aquatic plants and fills the diving bell with air carried from the surface. The bell can take up dissolved O2 from the water, acting as a ‘physical gill’. By measuring bell volume and O2 partial pressure (PO2) with tiny O2-sensitive optodes, this study showed that the spiders produce physical gills capable of satisfying at least their resting requirements for O2 under the most extreme conditions of warm stagnant water. Larger spiders produced larger bells of higher O2 conductance (GO2). GO2 depended on surface area only; effective boundary layer thickness was constant. Bells, with and without spiders, were used as respirometers by measuring GO2 and the rate of change in PO2. Metabolic rates were also measured with flow-through respirometry. The water–air PO2 difference was generally less than 10 kPa, and spiders voluntarily tolerated low internal PO2 approximately 1–4 kPa before renewal with air from the surface. The low PO2 in the bell enhanced N2 loss from the bell, but spiders could remain inside for more than a day without renewal.

Although indispensable during prolonged oxidative stress, these response systems depend on newly synthesized proteins, and are hence both time and energy consuming. Here, we describe an “express” cytoprotective system in Bacillus subtilis which depends on nitric oxide (NO). We show that NO immediately protects bacterial cells from reactive oxygen species by two independent mechanisms. NO transiently suppresses the enzymatic reduction of free cysteine that fuels the damaging Fenton reaction. In addition, NO directly reactivates catalase, a major antioxidant enzyme that has been inhibited in vivo by endogenous cysteine. Our data also reveal a critical role for bacterial NO-synthase in adaptation to oxidative stress associated with fast metabolic changes, and suggest a possible role for NO in defending pathogens against immune oxidative attack.","['Chemically modify', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.pnas.org/content/102/39/13855,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/39/13855.full.pdf,unknown
247,Total Internal Reflection Accounts for the Bright Color of the Saharan Silver Ant,,"The Saharan silver ant Cataglyphis bombycina is one of the terrestrial living organisms best adapted to tolerate high temperatures. It has recently been shown that the hairs covering the ant’s dorsal body part are responsible for its silvery appearance. The hairs have a triangular cross-section with two corrugated surfaces allowing a high optical reflection in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range of the spectrum while maximizing heat emissivity in the mid-infrared (MIR). Those two effects account for remarkable thermoregulatory properties, enabling the ant to maintain a lower thermal steady state and to cope with the high temperature of its natural habitat. In this paper, we further investigate how geometrical optical and high reflection properties account for the bright silver color of C. bombycina. Using optical ray-tracing models and attenuated total reflection (ATR) experiments, we show that, for a large range of incidence angles, total internal reflection (TIR) conditions are satisfied on the basal face of each hair for light entering and exiting through its upper faces. The reflection properties of the hairs are further enhanced by the presence of the corrugated surface, giving them an almost total specular reflectance for most incidence angles. We also show that hairs provide an almost 10-fold increase in light reflection, and we confirm experimentally that they are responsible for a lower internal body temperature under incident sunlight. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the optical mechanisms responsible for the silver color of C. bombycina and the remarkable thermoregulatory properties of the hair coat covering the ant’s body.","['Protect from harm', 'Process information', 'Chemically modify']",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152325,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152325&type=printable,unknown
248,Molecular sabotage of plant defense by aphid saliva,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0703535104,"Aphids, which constitute one of the most important groups of agricultural pests, ingest nutrients from sieve tubes, the photoassimilate transport conduits in plants. Aphids are able to successfully puncture sieve tubes with their piercing mouthparts (stylets) and ingest phloem sap without eliciting the sieve tubes' normal occlusion response to injury. Occlusion mechanisms are calcium-triggered and may be prevented by chemical constituents in aphid saliva injected into sieve tubes before and during feeding. We recorded aphid feeding behavior with the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique and then experimentally induced sieve tube plugging. Initiation of sieve tube occlusion caused a change in aphid behavior from phloem sap ingestion to secretion of watery saliva. Direct proof of “unplugging” properties of aphid saliva was provided by the effect of aphid saliva on forisomes. Forisomes are proteinaceous inclusions in sieve tubes of legumes that show calcium-regulated changes in conformation between a contracted state (below calcium threshold) that does not occlude the sieve tubes and a dispersed state (above calcium threshold) that occludes the sieve tubes. We demonstrated in vitro that aphid saliva induces dispersed forisomes to revert back to the nonplugging contracted state. Labeling Western-blotted saliva proteins with 45Ca2+ or ruthenium red inferred the presence of calcium-binding domains. These results demonstrate that aphid saliva has the ability to prevent sieve tube plugging by molecular interactions between salivary proteins and calcium. This provides aphids with access to a continuous flow of phloem sap and is a critical adaptation instrumental in the evolutionary success of aphids.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm', 'Chemically modify']",https://www.pnas.org/content/104/25/10536,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/25/10536.full.pdf,unknown

While basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis are known in eukaryotes, it is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo. To circumvent this issue, here we present a study of developing Vibrio cholerae biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are initially flat but later undergo a mechanical instability and become wrinkled. To gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic pattern-formation process, we developed a model that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the substrate, and the friction between them. Our model shows quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of biofilm expansion dynamics, and it accurately predicts two distinct spatiotemporal patterns observed in the experiments—the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral region and propagate inward (soft substrate/low friction) or in the central region and propagate outward (stiff substrate/high friction). Our results, which establish that nonuniform growth and friction are fundamental determinants of stress anisotropy and hence biofilm morphology, are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct wrinkle patterns. We discuss the implications of forming undulated biofilm morphologies, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules and serve as a “bet hedging” strategy.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/18/1919607117,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/18/1919607117.full.pdf,unknown

The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation. Unlike in birds, however, the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed, this is a surprising finding.

This finding suggested that the application of repellent could be used as part of filth fly management. Further evaluations of catnip oil toxicity were conducted to provide a broad-spectrum safety profile of catnip oil use as a potential biting and nuisance insect repellent in urban settings. Acute oral, dermal, inhalation, primary dermal and eye irritation toxicity tests were performed. The acute oral LD(50) of catnip oil was found to be 3160 mg/kg body weight (BW) and 2710 mg/kg BW in female and male rats, respectively. The acute dermal LD50 was > 5000 mg/kg BW. The acute inhalation LD50 was observed to be > 10,000 mg/m3. Primary skin irritation tested on New Zealand white rabbits showed that catnip oil is a moderate irritant. Catnip oil was classified as practically non-irritating to the eye.

We placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a UVR reflective substrate and showed that under ambient UVR levels, UVR transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a UVR reflective white substrate. In accordance with the lower levels of UVR measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons, a similar drop in UVR damage to their DNA was detected. The skeletons emitted absorbed UVR as yellow fluorescence, which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation.Conclusions/SignificanceOur study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong UVR absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals, and potentially other calcifiers, to thrive under UVR levels that are detrimental to most marine life.",['Protect from harm'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007995,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007995&type=printable,unknown

PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.","['Attach', 'Move']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2072,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2072.full.pdf,unknown
257,Bioprospecting Finds the Toughest Biological Material: Extraordinary Silk from a Giant Riverine Orb Spider,,"BackgroundCombining high strength and elasticity, spider silks are exceptionally tough, i.e., able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking. Spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41.000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200.000+ unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to ‘blindly fishing’ in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties?MethodologyWe examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‘Darwin's bark spider’ (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2.8 m2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3. Thus, C. darwini silk is more than twice tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough.ConclusionsCaerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history–informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011234,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011234&type=printable,unknown

We propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance, based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars (teeth with strikingly similar structural features). Section views of the enamel implicate tufts, hypomineralized crack-like defects at the enamel–dentin junction, as primary fracture sources. We report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects, by “stress shielding” from neighbors, by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving (decussation), and by self-healing. These factors, coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting, explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure, an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://www.pnas.org/content/106/18/7289,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/18/7289.full.pdf,unknown

261,Mechanisms of membrane fusion: disparate players and common principles,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm2417,"Membrane fusion in vivo involves the coordinated and leak-free merger of two bilayers. It requires that membranes are brought into close proximity, that there is local bilayer destabilization and that the overall process is given directionality. Fusion proteins control this process in cellular fusion events and these diverse proteins should therefore share these common activities.Energy is required for loosely tethered membranes to fuse: protein-free membranes must be brought into very close proximity, and initially a hemifusion intermediate is thought to form that proceeds through fusion-pore opening and dilation stages to full merging of the membranes.Fusion proteins (or complexes of fusion proteins) function by lowering energy barriers and giving directionality. Fusion proteins can be structurally very different and yet achieve the same end point. Tethering of membranes has been well studied, but how to make membranes fusogenic has been less well characterized.The induction of membrane-curvature stress in membranes by fusion proteins might turn out to be a common underappreciated feature of many fusion proteins that makes membranes fusogenic. In many cases membrane curvature stress can be achieved by shallow insertions into one monolayer of the membrane.Curvature induction might be mediated by the fusion peptides or loops of the viral fusion proteins, by C2 domains during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, by Ig-like domains in cell–cell fusion events, by membrane insertion of hydrophobic regions of tethering factors, or by oligomerization by dynamin superfamily GTPases (for example, during mitochondrial fusion).Future studies will have to address how close membrane proximity and curvature induction are coordinated in space and time in response to specific cellular cues.",['Process information'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm2417,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm2417.pdf,unknown

Each droplet is formed of a central mass of viscoelastic glycoprotein glue surrounded by an aqueous covering, both of which incorporate hydrophilic components. We found that the extensibility of droplets on Larinioides cornutus threads increased as humidity increased. However, the deflection of the droplets' supporting axial lines did not change, indicating that atmospheric water uptake increases glycoprotein plasticity, but not glycoprotein adhesion. The extensibility of droplets, along with that of the thread's supporting axial fibers, is responsible for summing the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. Therefore, daily changes in humidity have the potential to significantly alter the performance of viscous threads and orb webs.","['Attach', 'Maintain structural integrity']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2988,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2988.full.pdf,unknown

The free volume within a chiral cubic example of a dilatant weaving, the ideal conformation of the G129 weaving related to the Σ+ rod packing, expands more than fivefold on filament straightening. This remarkable three-dimensional weaving, therefore, allows an unprecedented variation of packing density without loss of structural rigidity and is an attractive design target for materials.

264,Stabilization and swelling of hagfish slime mucin vesicles,10.1242/jeb.038992,"When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l−1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.","['Change size or color', 'Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1092,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1092.full.pdf,unknown

Occurrence of resilin, a rubber–like protein, in some mobile joints together with data on wing unfolding and flight kinematics suggest that resilin in the beetle wing has multiple functions. First, the distribution pattern of resilin in the wing correlates with the particular folding pattern of the wing. Second, our data show that resilin occurs at the places where extra elasticity is needed, for example in wing folds, to prevent material damage during repeated folding and unfolding. Third, resilin provides the wing with elasticity in order to be deformable by aerodynamic forces.

Our experiments and theory overturn previous hypotheses that suggest that blooming is driven by differential growth of the inner layer of the petals and in the midrib by providing a qualitatively different paradigm that highlights the role of edge growth.

The bat wing contains five digits, and its specialized membrane is covered with stiff, microscopically small, domed hairs. We provide here unique empirical evidence that the tactile receptors associated with these hairs are involved in sensorimotor flight control by providing aerodynamic feedback. We found that neurons in bat primary somatosensory cortex respond with directional sensitivity to stimulation of the wing hairs with low-speed airflow. Wing hairs mostly preferred reversed airflow, which occurs under flight conditions when the airflow separates and vortices form. This finding suggests that the hairs act as an array of sensors to monitor flight speed and/or airflow conditions that indicate stall. Depilation of different functional regions of the bats’ wing membrane altered the flight behavior in obstacle avoidance tasks by reducing aerial maneuverability, as indicated by decreased turning angles and increased flight speed.",['Process information'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/27/11291,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/27/11291.full.pdf,unknown

Thecold adaptations of populations from northern Indiana (∼41°45′N) and Alaska were compared and, as expected, the supercooling points (thetemperatures at which they froze) of these freeze-avoiding insects weresignificantly lower in Alaska insects. Both populations produce glycerol, butthe concentrations in Alaska larvae were much higher than in Indiana insects(∼2.2 and 0.5 mol l–1, respectively). In addition, bothpopulations produce antifreeze proteins. Interestingly, in the autumn bothpopulations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis,indicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesizesimilar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaskalarvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreasesfrom 63–65% body water (1.70–1.85 g H2Og–1 dry mass) in summer to 28–40% body water(0.40–0.68 g H2O g–1 dry mass) in winter.These 2.5–4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase theconcentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects.

By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate inwinter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects fromIndiana do not.

269,Venom kinematics during prey capture in Conus: the biomechanics of a rapid injection system,10.1242/jeb.035550,"Cone snails use an extensile, tubular proboscis as a conduit to deliver a potent cocktail of bioactive venom peptides into their prey. Previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom's role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms. Conus catus, a fish-hunting species, uses a high-speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow, spear-like radular tooth into prey. We take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses. Taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc-hunting juvenile cone snail, Conus pennaceus, we have determined that a high-speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey. Two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process. A constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis, composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments, impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion. Proximal to the constriction, a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis. In C. pennaceus, the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom. The interplay between these elements provides a unique and effective biomechanical injection system for the fast-acting cone snail venom peptides.","['Attach', 'Process resources']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/673,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/673.full.pdf,unknown

It usually functions for 70 yr without failure, and works so efficiently that very little blood is regurgitated at each pulse. In order to support this large pressure difference, the cusps must close simultaneously in all operating conditions and should not touch the wall of the aorta, for considerable reversed flow would then be required to close the valve. This action suggests a fluid dynamic control mechanism which positions the cusps away from the wall of the aorta, so that the slightest reversed flow will close the valve.",['Process resources'],https://www.nature.com/articles/217086b0,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/217086b0.pdf,unknown

However, there are very significant gaps in our understanding of how diatoms take up and assimilate inorganic C. Diatom plastids originate from secondary endosymbiosis with a red alga and their Form ID Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) from horizontal gene transfer, which means that embryophyte paradigms can only give general guidance as to their C acquisition mechanisms. Although diatom Rubiscos have relatively high CO(2) affinity and CO(2)/O(2) selectivity, the low diffusion coefficient for CO(2) in water has the potential to restrict the rate of photosynthesis. Diatoms growing in their natural aquatic habitats operate inorganic C concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which provide a steady-state CO(2) concentration around Rubisco higher than that in the medium. How these CCMs work is still a matter of debate. However, it is known that both CO(2) and HCO (3) (-) are taken up, and an obvious but as yet unproven possibility is that active transport of these species across the plasmalemma and/or the four-membrane plastid envelope is the basis of the CCM. In one marine diatom there is evidence of C(4)-like biochemistry which could act as, or be part of, a CCM. Alternative mechanisms which have not been eliminated include the production of CO(2) from HCO (3) (-) at low pH maintained by a H(+) pump, in a compartment close to that containing Rubisco.",[],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17497225/,pubmed,,unknown

This study examined how the petioles manage to achieve adequate rigidity to do this, while allowing extensive and reversible reconfiguration in high winds. Morphological and anatomical examination of the petioles and leaves of Musa textilis suggested how these two apparently incompatible abilities are achieved. The hollow U-shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal strengthening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity, while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins. These features, however, also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind, while the leaf can fold away. In addition, two sets of internal structures, longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates, help prevent dorsoventral flattening, allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling. These ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests. Simple four-point-bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending. Axial bending tests and crushing tests showed that petioles could be flexed twice as far and were four times as resistant to dorsoventral flattening when intact than when the internal tissue is removed.

Modelling of these multi-layer structures suggests that they are responsible for the blue iridescence, confirming the link between the observed lamellae and the recorded optical properties. Comparison of blue and green leaves from the same plant indicates that the loss of the blue iridescence corresponds to a loss of the multi-layer structure. The results reported here do not support the idea that iridescence in plants acts to enhance light capture of photosynthetically important wavelengths. The reflectance of light in the range 600–700 nm is very similar for both iridescent and non-iridescent leaves.

A heat-sensitive glycoprotein fraction of Melosira EPS accounted for complex pore morphologies. Although all tested forms of EPS increased bulk ice salinity (by 11–59%) above the controls, ice containing native Melosira EPS retained the most salt.

Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms.Methodology/Principal FindingsIonizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of 14C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants.

Antifreeze activity is said3 to derive from the sorption of AFGP molecules on the active growth sites of ice crystals, preventing normal growth and inducing unusual crystal habits. We have performed experiments on the inhibition of ice crystal growth in solutions containing AFGP and PVP under standardized conditions, and find that the homogeneous nucleation and crystallization rates are sensitive to low concentrations of both substances, but AFGP is remarkably effective at inhibiting ice crystal growth.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.nature.com/articles/325146a0,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/325146a0.pdf,unknown

Here we describe a photovoltaic cell, created from low-to medium-purity materials through low-cost processes, which exhibits a commercially realistic energy-conversion efficiency. The device is based on a 10-µm-thick, optically transparent film of titanium dioxide particles a few nanometres in size, coated with a monolayer of a charge-transfer dye to sensitize the film for light harvesting. Because of the high surface area of the semiconductor film and the ideal spectral characteristics of the dye, the device harvests a high proportion of the incident solar energy flux (46%) and shows exceptionally high efficiencies for the conversion of incident photons to electrical current (more than 80%). The overall light-to-electric energy conversion yield is 7.1-7.9% in simulated solar light and 12% in diffuse daylight. The large current densities (greater than 12 mA cm-2) and exceptional stability (sustaining at least five million turnovers without decomposition), as well as the low cost, make practical applications feasible.",[],https://www.nature.com/articles/353737a0,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/353737a0.pdf,unknown

Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of ‘listening in’ and ‘broadcasting to’ unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom. The study of two-way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2009.0203,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2009.0203,unknown

Tension wood fibers that develop on one side of the stem have an increased potency to shrink compared with fibers on the opposite side, thus creating a bending moment. It is believed that the gelatinous (G) cell wall layer containing almost pure cellulose of tension wood fibers is pivotal to their shrinking. By analyzing saccharide composition and linkage in isolated G-layers of poplar, we found that they contain some matrix components in addition to cellulose, of which xyloglucan is the most abundant. Xyloglucan, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) activity and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene products were detected in developing G-layers by labeling using CCRC-M1 monoclonal antibody, in situ incorporation of XXXG-SR and the polyclonal antibody to poplar PttXET16-34, respectively, indicating that xyloglucan is incorporated into the G-layer during its development. Moreover, several XTH transcripts were altered and were generally up-regulated in developing tension wood compared with normal wood. In mature G-fibers, XTH gene products were detected in the G-layers while the XET activity was evident in the adjacent S(2) wall layer. We propose that XET activity is essential for G-fiber shrinking by repairing xyloglucan cross-links between G- and S(2)-layers and thus maintaining their contact. Surprisingly, XTH gene products and XET activity persisted in mature G-fibers for several years, suggesting that the enzyme functions after cell death repairing the cross-links as they are being broken during the shrinking process.",[],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17504814/,pubmed,,unknown

Here, we show that hummingbirds achieve these functional traits within the limits imposed by a vertebrate endoskeleton and muscle physiology by accentuating a wing inversion mechanism found in other birds and using long-axis rotational movement of the humerus. In hummingbirds, long-axis rotation of the humerus creates additional wing translational movement, supplementing that produced by the humeral elevation and depression movements of a typical avian flight stroke. This adaptation increases the wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio, and is emblematic of a widespread scaling trend among flying animals whereby wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio varies inversely with mass, allowing animals of vastly different sizes to accommodate aerodynamic, biomechanical and physiological constraints on muscle-powered flapping flight.",['Move'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2011.2238,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2011.2238,unknown

Moreover, they move so quickly that energy must be stored before a jump and then released suddenly. High speed imaging and analysis of the mechanics of the proximal joints of the hind legs show that mechanical mechanisms ensure both synchrony of movements and energy storage. The hind trochantera move first in jumping and are synchronised to within 30 μs. Synchrony is achieved by mechanical interactions between small protrusions from each trochantera which fluoresce bright blue under specific wavelengths of ultra-violet light and which touch at the midline when the legs are cocked before a jump. In dead Issus, a depression force applied to a cocked hind leg, or to the tendon of its trochanteral depressor muscle causes a simultaneous depression of both hind legs. The protrusion of the hind leg that moves first nudges the other hind leg so that both move synchronously. Contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles that precede a jump bend the metathoracic pleural arches of the internal skeleton. Large areas of these bow-shaped structures fluoresce bright blue in ultraviolet light, and the intensity of this fluorescence depends on the pH of the bathing saline. These are key signatures of the rubber-like protein resilin. The remainder of a pleural arch consists of stiff cuticle. Bending these composite structures stores energy and their recoil powers jumping.","['Process resources', 'Move']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/469,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/469.full.pdf,unknown

The system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble upon its removal over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically metastable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds a threshold value.

In fishes, light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells (intrinsic photophores), which are under direct nervous control, or symbiotic luminous bacteria (symbiotic photophores), whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression. The intrinsic photophores of the lantern shark Etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since they appear to be under hormonal control. Here, we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch, by acting on a chromatophore iris, which regulates light emission by pigment translocation. This result strongly suggests that this shark's luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores: the lantern shark would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage, more efficient in the deep-sea environment.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0167,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0167,unknown

Nest construction behaviour of túngara frogs, Engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. Pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.","['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0934,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0934,unknown

We find that bdelloids are also extraordinarily resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Reproduction of the bdelloids Adineta vaga and Philodina roseola is much more resistant to IR than that of Euchlanis dilatata, a rotifer belonging to the desiccation-intolerant and facultatively sexual class Monogononta, and all other animals for which we have found relevant data. By analogy with the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes DNA breakage that is repaired upon rehydration. Such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals.","['Protect from harm', 'Maintain ecological community']",https://www.pnas.org/content/105/13/5139,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/13/5139.full.pdf,unknown

Pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control. Such studies, however, cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free-flight aerodynamics. We directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and measurement of their behavioral response. High-speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial “stumble,” and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation. These insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within 2° in < 60 ms. To explain this recovery behavior, we form a feedback control model that includes the fly’s ability to sense body rotations, process this information, and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque. Thus, like early man-made aircraft and modern fighter jets, the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time-scale disturbances.","['Move', 'Protect from harm']",https://www.pnas.org/content/107/11/4820,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/11/4820.full.pdf,unknown

Top predators can regulate biotic interactions between species at lower trophic levels and may contribute to the stability of such mutualisms, but they are particularly likely to be lost after disturbance of communities. We focused on the mutualism between the fig tree Ficus microcarpa and its host-specific pollinator fig wasp and compared the benefits accrued by the mutualists in natural and translocated areas of distribution. Parasitoids of the pollinator were rare or absent outside the natural range of the mutualists, where the relative benefits the mutualists gained from their interaction were changed significantly away from the plant's natural range owing to reduced seed production rather than increased numbers of pollinator offspring. Furthermore, in the absence of the negative effects of its parasitoids, we detected an oviposition range expansion by the pollinator, with the use of a wider range of ovules that could otherwise have generated seeds. Loss of top-down control has therefore resulted in a change in the balance of reciprocal benefits that underpins this obligate mutualism, emphasizing the value of maintaining food web complexity in the Anthropocene.",['Protect from harm'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.2501,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.2501,unknown

Incorporation of mobile ligands in the lipid bilayer conferred specificity and slowed the translocation of targeted proteins sufficiently to time-resolve translocation events of individual proteins. Lipid coatings also prevented pores from clogging, eliminated non-specific binding and enabled the translocation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers and fibrils.

294,Optimal Predator Risk Assessment by the Sonar-Jamming Arctiine Moth Bertholdia trigona,,"Nearly all animals face a tradeoff between seeking food and mates and avoiding predation. Optimal escape theory holds that an animal confronted with a predator should only flee when benefits of flight (increased survival) outweigh the costs (energetic costs, lost foraging time, etc.). We propose a model for prey risk assessment based on the predator's stage of attack. Risk level should increase rapidly from when the predator detects the prey to when it commits to the attack. We tested this hypothesis using a predator – the echolocating bat – whose active biosonar reveals its stage of attack. We used a prey defense – clicking used for sonar jamming by the tiger moth Bertholdia trigona– that can be readily studied in the field and laboratory and is enacted simultaneously with evasive flight. We predicted that prey employ defenses soon after being detected and targeted, and that prey defensive thresholds discriminate between legitimate predatory threats and false threats where a nearby prey is attacked. Laboratory and field experiments using playbacks of ultrasound signals and naturally behaving bats, respectively, confirmed our predictions. Moths clicked soon after bats detected and targeted them. Also, B. trigona clicking thresholds closely matched predicted optimal thresholds for discriminating legitimate and false predator threats for bats using search and approach phase echolocation – the period when bats are searching for and assessing prey. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study to correlate the sensory stimuli that trigger defensive behaviors with measurements of signals provided by predators during natural attacks in the field. We propose theoretical models for explaining prey risk assessment depending on the availability of cues that reveal a predator's stage of attack.","['Process information', 'Protect from harm']",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063609,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063609&type=printable,unknown
295,Water relations of tetrapod integument,10.1242/jeb.02007,"The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between theneeds for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment andregulating the exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as ameans of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing astructural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier tocutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamentalimportance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in manycases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity offunction. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very littlekeratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that arepresent in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external tothe epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratincomplex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of theepidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from asuperficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding thestratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebratesgenerally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have`plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it isclear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account forcovariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studiesof the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamentalmechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrierthickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids,and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipidshave been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics,relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrierontogenesis related to adaptation and environment.

Mutagenesis and modelling studies suggest that several invariant residues in the putative luciferin-binding site of PxRE luciferase cannot interact with excited oxyluciferin.

Recent evidence suggests that aquaporin (AQP) water channels play critical roles in protecting cells from osmotic damage during freezing and desiccation. Our study sequenced, functionally characterized and measured the tissue abundance of an AQP from freeze-tolerant larvae of the gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). The newly characterized EsAQP1 contains two NPA motifs and six transmembrane regions, and is phylogenetically related to an AQP from the anhydrobiotic chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assay, we demonstrated that EsAQP1 increases water permeability to nine times that of simple diffusion through the membrane. In contrast to its high water permeability, EsAQP1 was impermeable to both glycerol and urea. The abundance of EsAQP1 increased from October to December in all tissues tested and was most abundant in the brain of winter larvae. Because the nervous system is thought to be the primary site of freezing injury, EsAQP1 may cryoprotect the brain from damage associated with water imbalance. The sequence, phylogenetic relationship, osmotic permeability, tissue distribution and seasonal abundance of EsAQP1 further support the role of AQPs in promoting freezing tolerance.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/848,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/848.full.pdf,unknown

This coevolution of male setae and female elytra has attracted much attention since Darwin. However, there has been little examination of their biomechanical functioning despite increasing knowledge on biofibrillar adhesion. Here, we report and compare, for the first time, the mechanisms of underwater attachment using two hair types, the primitive spatula and derived ‘passive’ sucker, found in male diving beetles. Results from interspecific scaling of protarsal palettes and adhesion by single seta suggest better performance in the later-evolved circular (sucker) setae. Spatula setae with a modified shallow sucker and channels use the combined mechanisms of suction and viscous resistance for adhesion. Velocity-dependent adhesion provides sufficient control for resisting the female's erratic movements while also detaching easily through slow peeling. Direction-dependent shear resistance helps reorient setae surfaces into a preferred direction for effective adhesion. Seta deformation using different mechanisms for circular and spatula setae reduces the force that is transmitted to the contact interface.

303,Water relations of tetrapod integument,10.1242/jeb.02007,"The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between theneeds for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment andregulating the exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as ameans of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing astructural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier tocutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamentalimportance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in manycases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity offunction. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very littlekeratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that arepresent in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external tothe epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratincomplex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of theepidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from asuperficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding thestratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebratesgenerally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have`plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it isclear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account forcovariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studiesof the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamentalmechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrierthickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids,and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipidshave been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics,relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrierontogenesis related to adaptation and environment. Advances in such knowledgehave didactic significance for understanding vertebrate evolution as well aspractical application to clinical dermatology.",['Protect from harm'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/2/202,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/2/202.full.pdf,unknown
304,Bug juice: harvesting electricity with microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro1442,"Microbial fuel cells have the potential to convert a wide diversity of organic wastes and renewable biomass to electricity. Many applications for microbial fuel cells are envisioned but, to date, the most practical use is the sediment microbial fuel cell, which is designed to recover electricity from the organic matter in aquatic sediments to power electronic-monitoring devices.In a microbial fuel cell, electrons derived from the microbial oxidation of organic matter are transferred to the anode under anaerobic conditions and travel through the device that is to be powered into the cathode, where they combine with oxygen to form water.It has recently been discovered that some microorganisms can completely oxidize organic compounds to carbon dioxide, with an electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor, and can conserve energy from this form of respiration. The term electricigens has been coined to describe such microorganisms.Electricigen-powered microbial fuel cells can covert organic compounds to electricity more efficiently than earlier versions of microbial fuel cells, and do not require electron-shuttling mediators, which add cost, often have poor stability and can be toxic to humans. Furthermore, as long as fuel is available, electricigens are self-sustaining, resulting in fuel cells with long term stability.The slow rate of conversion of organic matter to electricity in the currently available microbial fuel cells limits their application. Understanding the mechanisms of electron transfer to electrodes might help in designing anode materials that will promote faster electron transfer.It is unlikely that there has been any selective pressure on electricigens to produce electricity at high rates in natural environments. Therefore, there could be substantial potential for optimizing this process with genetic engineering or adaptive evolution.The availability of the complete genome sequence of several electricigens, such as Geobacter and Rhodoferax species, and the ability to track gene expression in electricigens growing on anodes, coupled with available genetic tools, is beginning to provide insights into the mechanisms of electron transfer to anodes.Electrodes can also serve as an electron donor for microbial respiration and this might have applications for the removal of contaminants, such as toxic metals, nitrate and chlorinated solvents from polluted waters.",[],https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro1442,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro1442.pdf,unknown

These birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations, yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks, even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted. Over the seemingly featureless ocean environment, local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts. These features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues. We have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), attracts procellariiforms at sea, suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue. Here we present the first physiological demonstration that an Antarctic seabird can detect DMS at biogenic levels. We further show that birds can use DMS as an orientation cue in a non-foraging context within a concentration range that they might naturally encounter over the ocean.",[],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0350?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0350?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed,unknown
306,The aerodynamics of insect flight,10.1242/jeb.00663,"The flight of insects has fascinated physicists and biologists for more than a century. Yet, until recently, researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings. However, recent developments in high-speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight. These mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models, combined with modern flow visualization techniques, have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non-flapping, 2-D wings on which most previous models were based. In particular, even at high angles of attack, a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake, as would be expected from non-flapping 2-D wings. Its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing, thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver. In addition, flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack, especially at stroke reversal, the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing-wake interactions following stroke reversal. This progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible. It also promises to foster new and exciting multi-disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology, biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution, and engineers who are inspired to build micro-robotic insects using these principles. This review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects, results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight, as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena.",['Move'],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14581590/,pubmed,,unknown

A bioluminescent organ, such as a firefly lantern, helps to out-couple light from the body in a highly efficient fashion for delivering strong optical signals in sexual communication. However, the cuticular nanostructures, except the light-producing reactions, have not been well investigated for physical principles and engineering biomimetics. Here we report a unique observation of high-transmission nanostructures on a firefly lantern and its biological inspiration for highly efficient LED illumination. Both numerical and experimental results clearly reveal high transmission through the nanostructures inspired from the lantern cuticle. The nanostructures on an LED lens surface were fabricated by using a large-area nanotemplating and reconfigurable nanomolding with heat-induced shear thinning. The biologically inspired LED lens, distinct from a smooth surface lens, substantially increases light transmission over visible ranges, comparable to conventional antireflection coating.

We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica. We conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them. The evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01416,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01416.pdf,unknown

310,Vortex wake and flight kinematics of a swift in cruising flight in a wind tunnel,10.1242/jeb.012146,"In this paper we describe the flight characteristics of a swift (Apusapus) in cruising flight at three different flight speeds (8.0, 8.4 and9.2 m s–1) in a low turbulence wind tunnel. The wingbeatkinematics were recorded by high-speed filming and the wake of the bird wasvisualized by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Certain flightcharacteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species.As the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the wingbeat remainsconstant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases, the frequency decreasesaccordingly, as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate.The wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted ratherlittle during the upstroke. The upstroke is always aerodynamically active andthis is reflected in the wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occursthroughout the wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those ofother birds in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vorticesconnected by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positivevorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during theupstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and thendecreasing during the wingbeat cycle. The wake (and implied wing aerodynamics)are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but a new wake-basedmodel, where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wakeimpulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows good agreement of the verticalmomentum flux with the required weight support. The total drag was alsoestimated from the wake alone, and the calculated lift:drag ratio ofapproximately 13 for flapping flight is the highest measured yet forbirds.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/5/717,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/5/717.full.pdf,unknown

This study explored the relationship between ammonia excretion, glutamine storage/mobilization, and water balance, in two sympatric species Ligidium lapetum (section Diplocheta), a hygric species; and Armadillidium vulgare (Section Crinocheta), a xeric species capable of water-vapor absorption (WVA). Ammonia excretion (12-h), tissue glutamine levels, and water contents were measured following field collection of animals at dusk and dawn. In both species, diurnal ammonia excretion exceeded nocturnal excretion four- to fivefold while glutamine levels increased four- to sevenfold during the night. Most glutamine was accumulated in the somatic tissues (""body wall""). While data support the role of glutamine in nocturnal nitrogen storage, potential nitrogen mobilization from glutamine breakdown (162 micromol g(-1) in A. vulgare) exceeds measured ammonia excretion (2.5 micromol g(-1)) over 60-fold. This may serve to generate the high hemolymph ammonia concentrations (and high P(NH3)) seen during volatilization. The energetic cost of ammonia volatilization is discussed in the light of these findings. Mean water contents were similar at dusk and dawn in both species, indicating that diel cycles of water depletion and replenishment were not occurring.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15578188/,pubmed,,unknown
312,"A Unique Resource Mutualism between the Giant Bornean Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes rajah, and Members of a Small Mammal Community",,"The carnivorous pitcher plant genus Nepenthes grows in nutrient-deficient substrates and produce jug-shaped leaf organs (pitchers) that trap arthropods as a source of N and P. A number of Bornean Nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies. Notably, three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew, Tupaia montana, in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers' lids.Although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated, many aspects are yet to be investigated. We sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant. During initial observations we discovered that the summit rat, R. baluensis, also feeds on sugary exudates of N. rajah pitchers and defecates into them, and that this behavior appears to be habitual. The scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree N. rajah interacts with the small mammal community.We found that both T. montana and R. baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with N. rajah. T .montana visit pitchers more frequently than R. baluensis, but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ, suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community.

Three-dimensional arrays of laser-generated microcracks can deflect and guide larger incoming cracks, following the concept of ‘stamp holes’. Jigsaw-like interfaces, infiltrated with polyurethane, furthermore channel cracks into interlocking configurations and pullout mechanisms, significantly enhancing energy dissipation and toughness.

The vast majority of known silks are large, repetitive proteins assembled into extended beta-sheet structures. Honeybees, however, have found a radically different evolutionary solution to the need for a building material. The 4 fibrous proteins of honeybee silk are small ( approximately 30 kDa each) and nonrepetitive and adopt a coiled coil structure. We examined silks from the 3 superfamilies of the Aculeata (Hymenoptera: Apocrita) by infrared spectroscopy and found coiled coil structure in bees (Apoidea) and in ants (Vespoidea) but not in parasitic wasps of the Chrysidoidea. We subsequently identified and sequenced the silk genes of bumblebees, bulldog ants, and weaver ants and compared these with honeybee silk genes. Each species produced orthologues of the 4 small fibroin proteins identified in honeybee silk. Each fibroin contained a continuous predicted coiled coil region of around 210 residues, flanked by 23-160 residue length N- and C-termini. The cores of the coiled coils were unusually rich in alanine. There was extensive sequence divergence among the bee and ant silk genes (<50% similarity between the alignable regions of bee and ant sequences), consistent with constant and equivalent divergence since the bee/ant split (estimated to be 155 Myr).

316,An experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.3675,"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals. Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1—representing high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet–blue chroma—and hue). Two different colour parameters (violet–blue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2006.3675,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2006.3675,unknown

We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.","['Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1939,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2008.1939,unknown

Their mechanical properties therefore inevitably affect functioning of the legs; yet interspecific studies of the scaling of locomotor mechanics have all but neglected the feet and their soft tissues. Here we determine how contact area and stiffness of footpads in digitigrade carnivorans scale with body mass in order to show how footpads’ mechanical properties and size covary to maintain their functional integrity. As body mass increases across several orders of magnitude, we find the following: (i) foot contact area does not keep pace with increasing body mass; therefore pressure increases, placing footpad tissue of larger animals potentially at greater risk of damage; (ii) but stiffness of the pads also increases, so the tissues of larger animals must experience less strain; and (iii) total energy stored in hindpads increases slightly more than that in the forepads, allowing additional elastic energy to be returned for greater propulsive efficiency. Moreover, pad stiffness appears to be tuned across the size range to maintain loading regimes in the limbs that are favourable for long-bone remodelling. Thus, the structural properties of footpads, unlike other biological support-structures, scale interspecifically through changes in both geometry and material properties, rather than geometric proportions alone, and do so with consequences for both maintenance and operation of other components of the locomotor system.",['Maintain structural integrity'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2009.0556,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2009.0556,unknown
322,Hydraulic leg extension is not necessarily the main drive in large spiders,10.1242/jeb.054585,"Unlike most other arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in major leg joints. Therefore, hydraulic pressure generated in the prosoma provides leg extension. For decades, this mechanism was held responsible for the generation of the majority of the ground reaction forces, particularly in the hind legs. During propulsion, the front leg pairs must shorten whereas the hind legs have to be extended. Assuming that hind legs are essentially driven by hydraulics, their force vectors must pass the leg joints ventrally. However, at least in accelerated escape manoeuvres, we show here for the large cursorial spider species Ancylometes concolor that these force vectors, when projected into the leg plane, pass all leg joints dorsally. This indicates a reduced impact of the hydraulic mechanism on the generation of ground reaction forces. Although hydraulic leg extension still modulates their direction, the observed steep force vectors at the hind legs indicate a strong activity of flexors in the proximal joint complex that push the legs against the substrate. Consequently, the muscular mechanisms are dominant at least in the hind legs of large spiders.","['Move', 'Chemically modify']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/578,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/578.full.pdf,unknown

When the pinnae were vasodilated, the thermocouple measurements were consistently higher than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically. When the pinnae were vasoconstricted, the thermocouple measurements were consistently lower than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically.

324,Force production and flow structure of the leading edge vortex on flapping wings at high and low Reynolds numbers,10.1242/jeb.00848,"The elevated aerodynamic performance of insects has been attributed in partto the generation and maintenance of a stable region of vorticity known as theleading edge vortex (LEV). One explanation for the stability of the LEV isthat spiraling axial flow within the vortex core drains energy into the tipvortex, forming a leading-edge spiral vortex analogous to the flow structuregenerated by delta wing aircraft. However, whereas spiral flow is aconspicuous feature of flapping wings at Reynolds numbers (Re) of5000, similar experiments at Re=100 failed to identify a comparablestructure. We used a dynamically scaled robot to investigate both the forcesand the flows created by a wing undergoing identical motion at Re of∼120 and ∼1400. In both cases, motion at constant angular velocity andfixed angle of attack generated a stable LEV with no evidence of shedding. AtRe=1400, flow visualization indicated an intense narrow region ofspanwise flow within the core of the LEV, a feature conspicuously absent atRe=120. The results suggest that the transport of vorticity from theleading edge to the wake that permits prolonged vortex attachment takesdifferent forms at different Re.",['Move'],https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/7/1063,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/7/1063.full.pdf,unknown
325,Gait selection in the ostrich: mechanical and metabolic characteristics of walking and running with and without an aerial phase,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2702,"It has been argued that minimization of metabolic–energy costs is a primary determinant of gait selection in terrestrial animals. This view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses, which have been shown to choose the most economical gait (walking, running, galloping) for any given speed. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits, such as grounded running (a widespread gait in birds). Using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from 0.8 to 6.7 m s−1, we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion. This gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted–pendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase. By contrast, when the ostrich adopts an aerial–running gait at faster speeds, there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion. These data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running, indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm.",['Move'],https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2702,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2702,unknown

Colonies of this species have up to 200 000 foragers and transport more than 3000 prey items per hour over raiding columns that exceed 100 m. It is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants.

The propulsive efficiency of the species is believed to be one of the highest measured for a thrust generating apparatus within the animal kingdom. The goals of this research were to understand the distinctive biological mechanisms that allow the beetles to swim and dive, while searching for potential bio-inspired robotics applications. Through static and dynamic measurements obtained using a combination of microscopy and high-speed imaging, parameters associated with the morphology and beating kinematics of the whirligig beetle's legs in swimming and diving were obtained. Using data obtained from these experiments, dynamics models of both swimming and diving were developed. Through analysis of simulations conducted using these models it was possible to determine several key principles associated with the swimming and diving processes. First, we determined that curved swimming trajectories were more energy efficient than linear trajectories, which explains why they are more often observed in nature. Second, we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs, and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs. However, analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories, and thus were necessary for steering. Finally, we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving, the legs must change the plane in which they beat, which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water.

Here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome, including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production. The daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires ∼40% less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle. This strategy is energetically expensive, but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans. A global numerical model of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that Crocosphaera’s ability to reduce its iron-metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages: It allows Crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher Crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement.",['Physically assemble/disassemble'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/6/2184,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/6/2184.full.pdf,unknown

We show that m-tyrosine exposure results in growth inhibition for a wide range of plant species and propose that the release of this nonprotein amino acid interferes with root development of competing plants. Acid hydrolysis of total root protein from Arabidopsis thaliana showed incorporation of m-tyrosine, suggesting this as a possible mechanism of phytotoxicity. m-Tyrosine inhibition of A. thaliana root growth is counteracted by exogenous addition of protein amino acids, with phenylalanine having the most significant effect.

The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs ofcolour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriatelynanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e.differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths.Previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent, Tyndallscattering, the scales of Papilio zalmoxis are not appropriatelynanostructured for incoherent scattering. Rather, available data indicate thatthe blue of P. zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour.

Here we show that unexplored combinations of engineering structures (backward-facing steps forming d-type ribs on the porous surface of a cone) cause fluid dynamic phenomena distinct from current biological and industrial filter operations. This vortical cross-step filtration model prevents clogging and explains the transport of tiny concentrated particles to the oesophagus using a hydrodynamic tongue.

We measured discrimination of sound-source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response. The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination.",['Process information'],https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000675,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000675&type=printable,unknown

336,Structural Basis for the Aminoacid Composition of Proteins from Halophilic Archea,,"Proteins from halophilic organisms, which live in extreme saline conditions, have evolved to remain folded at very high ionic strengths. The surfaces of halophilic proteins show a biased amino acid composition with a high prevalence of aspartic and glutamic acids, a low frequency of lysine, and a high occurrence of amino acids with a low hydrophobic character. Using extensive mutational studies on the protein surfaces, we show that it is possible to decrease the salt dependence of a typical halophilic protein to the level of a mesophilic form and engineer a protein from a mesophilic organism into an obligate halophilic form. NMR studies demonstrate complete preservation of the three-dimensional structure of extreme mutants and confirm that salt dependency is conferred exclusively by surface residues. In spite of the statistically established fact that most halophilic proteins are strongly acidic, analysis of a very large number of mutants showed that the effect of salt on protein stability is largely independent of the total protein charge. Conversely, we quantitatively demonstrate that halophilicity is directly related to a decrease in the accessible surface area.","['Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257,plos,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257&type=printable,unknown

The completed genome sequence of Syntrophus aciditrophicus SB, a model fatty acid- and aromatic acid-degrading syntrophic bacterium, provides a glimpse of the composition and architecture of the electron transfer and energy-transducing systems needed to exist on marginal energy economies of a syntrophic lifestyle. The genome contains 3,179,300 base pairs and 3,169 genes where 1,618 genes were assigned putative functions. Metabolic reconstruction of the gene inventory revealed that most biosynthetic pathways of a typical Gram-negative microbe were present. A distinctive feature of syntrophic metabolism is the need for reverse electron transport; the presence of a unique Rnf-type ion-translocating electron transfer complex, menaquinone, and membrane-bound Fe-S proteins with associated heterodisulfide reductase domains suggests mechanisms to accomplish this task. Previously undescribed approaches to degrade fatty and aromatic acids, including multiple AMP-forming CoA ligases and acyl-CoA synthetases seem to be present as ways to form and dissipate ion gradients by using a sodium-based energy strategy. Thus, S. aciditrophicus, although nutritionally self-sufficient, seems to be a syntrophic specialist with limited fermentative and respiratory metabolism.

Electrophysiological recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and peripheral nerves were made to isolate single-unit receptive fields and to test possible osmoreceptive and electroreceptive functions. Multiple small (<0.1 mm2) receptive fields, often from a single ISO, were recorded from the premaxilla, the rostral dentary, the gingivae and the distal digits. These responded to a median threshold of 0.08 mN. The less densely innervated caudal margins of the jaws had larger receptive fields (>100 mm2) and higher thresholds (13.725 mN). Rapidly adapting, slowly adapting type I and slowly adapting type II responses were identified based on neuronal responses. Several rapidly adapting units responded maximally to vibrations at 20–35 Hz, consistent with reports of the ISOs' role in detecting prey-generated water surface ripples.

responses to humidity in spider dragline silk",10.1242/jeb.028944,"Spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development ofbiomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low densitypolymers. These applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts todifferent environmental conditions. For instance, spider dragline silk`supercontracts' in high humidity. During supercontraction, unrestraineddragline silk contracts up to 50% of its original length and restrained fibersgenerate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of draglinesilk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Ourfindings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively differentresponses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclicrelaxation–contraction response to wetting and drying. The direction andmagnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and aftersupercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a `permanent' tensioning ofrestrained silk in response to high humidity. Here, water induces stress,rather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in apermanent change in molecular composition of the silk, as demonstrated bythermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even after drying, silk mass increased by∼1% after supercontraction. By contrast, the cyclic response to humidityinvolves a reversible uptake of water. Dried, post-supercontraction silk alsodiffers mechanically from virgin silk. Post-supercontraction silk exhibitsreduced stiffness and stress at yield, as well as changes in dynamic energystorage and dissipation. In addition to advancing understandingsupercontraction, our findings open up new applications for synthetic silkanalogs.

The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids.

Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses.Methodology/Principal FindingsThe presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H2O2 scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H2O2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H2O2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts.Conclusions/SignificanceBoth naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H2O2 scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color.

Thus, structural components of feathers contribute substantially to yellow ‘carotenoid’ displays, but the effect of variation in structural components on variation in colour displays is, to our knowledge, unstudied. The presence of structural colour in some carotenoid-based colour displays will have to be considered in studies of colour signalling.","['Process information', 'Change size or color']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2004.0289,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2004.0289,unknown

349,Deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces via mucin strands,10.1242/jeb.038075,"Hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of slime when threatened. The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 μm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100× longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces.","['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1235,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1235.full.pdf,unknown

Algal cells are detectable from embryonic and larval Stages 26–44 through chlorophyll autofluorescence and algal 18S rDNA amplification. Algal cell ultrastructure indicates both degradation and putative encystment during the process of tissue and cellular invasion. Fewer algal cells were detected in later-stage larvae through FISH, suggesting that the decline in autofluorescent cells is primarily due to algal cell death within the host. However, early embryonic egg capsules also contained encysted algal cells on the inner capsule wall, and algal 18S rDNA was amplified from adult reproductive tracts, consistent with oviductal transmission of algae from one salamander generation to the next.

The results show that under physiological flow conditions, three-dimensionality can reduce both the range and extent of low WSS regions and substantially increase oxygen flux through the walls. The Sherwood number and WSS distributions between the three-dimensional helical model and a human coronary artery show remarkable qualitative agreement, implying that coronary arteries may potentially be described with a relatively simple idealized three-dimensional model, characterized by a small number of well-defined geometric parameters.

While the biochemical composition of the slime is known, its unusual nature and the mechanism of ensnaring thread formation have remained elusive. We have examined gene expression in the slime gland from an Australian onychophoran, Euperipatoides rowelli, and matched expressed sequence tags to separated proteins from the slime. The analysis revealed three categories of protein present: unique high-molecular-weight proline-rich proteins, and smaller concentrations of lectins and small peptides, the latter two likely to act as protease inhibitors and antimicrobial agents. The predominant proline-rich proteins (200 kDa+) are composed of tandem repeated motifs and distinguished by an unusually high proline and charged residue content. Unlike the highly structured proteins such as silks used for prey capture by spiders and insects, these proteins lack ordered secondary structure over their entire length. We propose that on expulsion of slime from the gland onto prey, evaporative water loss triggers a glass transition change in the protein solution, resulting in adhesive and enmeshing thread formation, assisted by cross-linking of complementary charged and hydrophobic regions of the protein. Euperipatoides rowelli has developed an entirely new method of capturing prey by harnessing disordered proteins rather than structured, silk-like proteins.","['Attach', 'Physically assemble/disassemble']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0604,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0604,unknown

Protection of the newly synthesized cuticle from molting fluid enzymes has long been attributed to the presence of an impermeable envelope layer that was thought to serve as a physical barrier, preventing molting fluid enzymes from accessing the new cuticle and thereby ensuring selective degradation of only the old one. In this study, using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model insect species, we show that an entirely different and unexpected mechanism accounts for the selective action of chitinases and possibly other molting enzymes. The molting fluid enzyme chitinase, which degrades the matrix polysaccharide chitin, is not excluded from the newly synthesized cuticle as previously assumed. Instead, the new cuticle is protected from chitinase action by the T. castaneum Knickkopf (TcKnk) protein. TcKnk colocalizes with chitin in the new cuticle and organizes it into laminae. Down-regulation of TcKnk results in chitinase-dependent loss of chitin, severe molting defects, and lethality at all developmental stages. The conservation of Knickkopf across insect, crustacean, and nematode taxa suggests that its critical roles in the laminar ordering and protection of exoskeletal chitin may be common to all chitinous invertebrates.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/108/41/17028,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/41/17028.full.pdf,unknown

These feats are accomplished using awns, helical bristles of dead but hygroscopically active tissue attached to the seeds. Here, we describe the kinematics of explosive dispersal and self-burial based on detailed high-speed and time-lapse videos. We use these observations to develop a simple mechanical model that accounts for the coiling behavior of the awn and allows comparison of the strain energy stored in the awn with the kinetic energy at launch. The model is used to examine tradeoffs between dispersal distance and reliability of the dispersal mechanism. The mechanical model may help in understanding the invasive potential of this species and provides a framework for examining other evolutionary tradeoffs in seed dispersal mechanisms among the Geraniaceae.","['Attach', 'Move', 'Process resources']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/521,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/521.full.pdf,unknown

Formation of the intricate silica structures of diatoms is regarded as a paradigm for biomolecule-controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional, nano- to microscale-patterned inorganic materials. Silica formation involves long-chain polyamines and phosphoproteins (silaffins and silacidins), which are readily soluble in water, and spontaneously form dynamic supramolecular assemblies that accelerate silica deposition and influence silica morphogenesis in vitro. However, synthesis of diatom-like silica structure in vitro has not yet been accomplished, indicating that additional components are required. Here we describe the discovery and intracellular location of six novel proteins (cingulins) that are integral components of a silica-forming organic matrix (microrings) in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. The cingulin-containing microrings are specifically associated with girdle bands, which constitute a substantial part of diatom biosilica. Remarkably, the microrings exhibit protein-based nanopatterns that closely resemble characteristic features of the girdle band silica nanopatterns. Upon the addition of silicic acid the microrings become rapidly mineralized in vitro generating nanopatterned silica replicas of the microring structures. A silica-forming organic matrix with characteristic nanopatterns was also discovered in the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which suggests that preassembled protein-based templates might be general components of the cellular machinery for silica morphogenesis in diatoms.

The molecular basis of spore dormancy and resistance is not understood, but the physical state of water in the different spore compartments is thought to play a key role. To characterize this water in situ, we recorded the water 2H and 17O spin relaxation rates in D2O-exchanged Bacillus subtilis spores over a wide frequency range. The data indicate high water mobility throughout the spore, comparable with binary protein–water systems at similar hydration levels. Even in the dense core, the average water rotational correlation time is only 50 ps. Spore dormancy therefore cannot be explained by glass-like quenching of molecular diffusion but may be linked to dehydration-induced conformational changes in key enzymes. The data demonstrate that most spore proteins are rotationally immobilized, which may contribute to heat resistance by preventing heat-denatured proteins from aggregating irreversibly. We also find that the water permeability of the inner membrane is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than for model membranes, consistent with the reported high degree of lipid immobilization in this membrane and with its proposed role in spore resistance to chemicals that damage DNA. The quantitative results reported here on water mobility and transport provide important clues about the mechanism of spore dormancy and resistance, with relevance to food preservation, disease prevention, and astrobiology.",['Protect from harm'],https://www.pnas.org/content/106/46/19334,pnas,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/46/19334.full.pdf,unknown

Unlike human-designed systems, there is no deliberate planning or centralized control system; rather, individual insects make simple decisions based on local information. How do these highly decentralized, leaderless systems deal with disruption? What factors make a social insect system resilient, and which factors lead to its collapse? In this review, we bring together literature on resilience in three key social insect infrastructure systems: transportation networks, supply chains and communication networks. We describe how systems differentially invest in three pathways to resilience: resistance, redirection or reconstruction. We suggest that investment in particular resistance pathways is related to the severity and frequency of disturbance. In the final section, we lay out a prospectus for future research. Human infrastructure networks are rapidly becoming decentralized and interconnected; indeed, more like social insect infrastructures. Human infrastructure management might therefore learn from social insect researchers, who can in turn make use of the mature analytical and simulation tools developed for the study of human infrastructure resilience.","['Maintain ecological community', 'Process resources']",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2015.1022,royalsocietypublishing,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2015.1022,unknown

The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators.

For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a “sterilization parasite” that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these “parasites” enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages.

Fibrous keratins evolved as ameans of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing astructural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier tocutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamentalimportance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in manycases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity offunction. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very littlekeratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that arepresent in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external tothe epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratincomplex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of theepidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from asuperficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding thestratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebratesgenerally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have`plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it isclear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account forcovariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studiesof the relative importance of these two phenomena are few.

Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created. An amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support, including anemones and other polyps, the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates, the tube feet of echinoderms, mammalian and turtle penises, the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails, and the legs of spiders. In addition, there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods, the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid-filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type. Although we normally consider arthropods to rely on a rigid exoskeleton, a hydrostatic skeleton provides skeletal support immediately following molting and also during the larval stage for many insects. Thus, the majority of animals on earth rely on hydrostatic skeletons.","['Process resources', 'Maintain structural integrity', 'Move', 'Physically assemble/disassemble']",https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1247,jeb,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1247.full.pdf,unknown
